Simple bone cysts are benign, fluid-filled cavities that can occur in any bone of the body, and they often cause no symptoms unless they become infected or rupture. The fallen fragment sign is a common finding in simple bone cysts, and it is characterized by a fragment of bone that has broken off and is displaced from its normal position.
