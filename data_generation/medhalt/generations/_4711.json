This angle is important for the proper functioning of the rectum and anus, and helps to maintain continence.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: The longitudinal muscle layer of smooth muscle is responsible for the anorectal angle, which is formed due to the contraction of this layer. The circular muscle layer, on the other hand, is responsible for the rectal ampulla.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The puborectalis muscle is a thin, triangular muscle that arises from the pubic bone and inserts into the rectum.
