The presence of a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina is consistent with a uterine fibroid or a cervical teratoma, which are common in patients with Turner syndrome. The absence of fetal heart sounds on ultrasound is also consistent with a non-viable pregnancy.

A molar pregnancy is a rare condition that occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus but does not properly develop. The patient's history of a missed abortion and the presence of no fetal heart sounds on examination are also consistent with a molar pregnancy.
