The proximal segment is located farthest from the radiocarpal joint and has a relatively poor blood supply, which can lead to avascular necrosis. In contrast, the distal segment is closer to the radiocarpal joint and has a better blood supply, making it less susceptible to avascular necrosis. The scaphoid tubercle is also a vascularized area and is less likely to develop avascular necrosis.
