In fact, the use of IUCDs is associated with a reduced risk of PID.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the cervical cap is a barrier method of contraception that covers the cervix, and thus prevents the sperm from reaching the egg. The other options (IUCD, OCP, and diaphragm) are not barrier methods and do not prevent the sperm from reaching the egg.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: OCPs are not aggravated by PID because they are not a barrier method. PID is caused by the presence of bacteria in the cervix, and the use of a barrier method such as a cervical cap or diaphragm can prevent the bacteria from entering the cervix.
