The FDA has recommended the use of 0.03% tacrolimus topical or 1% pimecrolimus as the drug of choice for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in infants, as they are less likely to cause these side effects.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the statement is false. Seborrheic dermatitis is a common condition that can co-exist with atopic dermatitis, and it is not a differential diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: That's correct because atopic dermatitis typically affects the extensor surfaces of the body, such as the face, limbs, and scalp, rather than the flexor surfaces.\n<human>"}, {"question": "In relation to the photoreceptors:", "correct_answer": "When illuminated, the input current of Na + increases.", "options": ["A)Sinaptan with ganglion cells.", "B)When illuminated, the input current of Na + increases.", "C)The canes provide color vision.", "D)Light dissociates rhodopsin in its components."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:In relation to the photoreceptors:A)Sinaptan with ganglion cells.

The sinaptan is the site of transmission of the visual signal from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because when light enters the photoreceptor, it causes a decrease in the concentration of Na + ions in the outer segment of the cell, which increases the input current of Na + ions through the voltage-gated Na + channel.

This can lead to anemia due to a decrease in the absorption of vitamin B12 and iron.

Additionally, the presence of macrocytosis and hypergastrinemia supports this diagnosis. Medullary hypoplasia is a rare complication of long-term colchicine therapy, which can cause anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

Therefore, the most likely cause of anemia in this patient is hematic losses due to gastritis and peptic ulcers related to steroid treatment.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Methimazole can cause hemolytic anemia due to its toxic effect on red blood cells, especially when used in high doses or for long periods. In this case, the patient is taking methimazole for the treatment of Graves' disease, and the dose is relatively high (10 mg/d). Additionally, the patient has a history of lupus arthropathy, which is a known risk factor for hemolytic anemia.
