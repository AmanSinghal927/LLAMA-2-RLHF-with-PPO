When TRH is released from the hypothalamus, it stimulates the release of TSH from the pituitary gland. However, high levels of thyroid hormones (TH) in the bloodstream can inhibit the release of TSH from the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the production of TH. Therefore, TSH is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Prolactin is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus, specifically the dopamine produced by neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH).
