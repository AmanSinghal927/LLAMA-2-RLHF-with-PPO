Older children in the last courses of Primary Education are in a better position to benefit from the turtle technique, as they have a more developed cognitive ability and are more mature emotionally.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The turtle technique is indicated for preadolescents because it is a stage of development where children are beginning to learn more complex skills and concepts, and the technique can help them to develop these skills in a more gradual and controlled way. Additionally, preadolescents are often more focused on their own interests and less on the opinions of others, which can make it easier for them to learn and practice the technique without feeling self-conscious.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot> A: The turtle technique is appropriate for adolescents because it focuses on the development of self-regulation skills, such as self-control, self-awareness, and self-motivation, which are crucial for this age group as they transition into young adulthood.
