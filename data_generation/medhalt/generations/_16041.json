In prerenal acute renal failure, the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine due to decreased blood flow, resulting in dilute urine with a low osmolality. In intrinsic renal acute renal failure, the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine due to damage to the nephrons, also resulting in dilute urine with a low osmolality.
