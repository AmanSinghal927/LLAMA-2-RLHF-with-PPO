Thymidine dimers are formed when two thymidine nucleotides on opposite strands of DNA are linked together by a covalent bond, resulting in a bulge in the DNA double helix. This can lead to the formation of DNA lesions and ultimately to cell death.\n\n", "output2": "\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Radiation therapy works by breaking the DNA molecule, which in turn leads to the formation of free radicals that damage the DNA. Cytosine is one of the building blocks of DNA, and when it is exposed to radiation, it can undergo deamination, which is the loss of an amino group. This can result in the formation of mutagenic lesions that can lead to the death of cancer cells.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When high-energy radiation, such as from external beam radiation, interacts with the DNA molecule, it can cause breaks in the double-stranded structure. This is because the DNA molecule is made up of two strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds. When the radiation hits the DNA, it can cause the hydrogen bonds to break, resulting in breaks in the DNA molecule. This can lead to the death of the cancer cells, as they are unable to repair the damage caused by the radiation.\n\n"}, {"question": "Hemophilics show:", "correct_answer": "Increased bleeding time and clotting time", "options": ["A)Increased bleeding time and clotting time", "B)Normal bleeding time and increased clotting time", "C)Decreased bleeding time and clotting time", "D)Decreased bleeding time and increased clotting time"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Hemophilics show:A)Increased bleeding time and clotting time B)Normal bleeding time and increased clotting time C)Decreased bleeding time and clotting time D)Decreased bleeding time and increased clotting time\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Hemophiliacs have a deficiency in clotting factors, which results in a longer bleeding time and a longer clotting time.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because hemophiliacs have a deficiency in clotting factors, which leads to a prolonged clotting time and normal bleeding time.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Hemophiliacs have a deficiency in clotting factors, which leads to a decrease in bleeding time and a decrease in clotting time.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Hemophiliacs have a deficiency of clotting factor, which leads to a decrease in bleeding time but an increase in clotting time.\n\n"}, {"question": "During a respiratory cycle at rest, the pressure:", "correct_answer": "Intrapleural is always positive.", "options": ["A)Transpulmonary becomes negative in expiration.", "B)Intrapleural does not change.", "C)Transpulmonary is always positive.", "D)Intrapleural is always positive."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:During a respiratory cycle at rest, the pressure:A)Transpulmonary becomes negative in expiration.
