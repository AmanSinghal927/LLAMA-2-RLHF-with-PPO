It simply maintains the resting state of the neuron.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: When the membrane of a neuron is hyperpolarized, the neuron is more readily able to conduct impulses. This is because the membrane potential is more negative, which increases the resistance to the flow of ions across the membrane. As a result, the neuron is able to transmit impulses more effectively.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When a neuron is hyperpolarized, the membrane potential becomes more negative, making it harder for the neuron to conduct impulses. This can cause the neuron to be depressed for a longer time.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of episodic pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs for 4 months.
