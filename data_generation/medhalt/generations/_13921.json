This biphasic pattern of flow is typical of the venous system in the lower limbs.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Venous blood flow in the lower limb is typically monophasic, meaning that it has only one waveform. This is because the veins in the lower limb are typically compliant, meaning that they stretch and expand as blood flows through them.
