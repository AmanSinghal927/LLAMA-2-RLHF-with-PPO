One of the characteristic features of this condition is the absence of the uterus and ovaries. The patient's breasts are also underdeveloped.

This enzyme is necessary for the production of cortisol and aldosterone hormones. The patient's symptoms, such as absent menstruation, sparse pubic hair, and bilateral inguinal masses, are all consistent with CAH. Testosterone therapy is the most appropriate treatment for CAH, as it can help to increase the levels of cortisol and aldosterone in the body.\n\n"}, {"question": "Alba, a 66-year-old woman who has been the main caretaker of her husband for 10 years.
