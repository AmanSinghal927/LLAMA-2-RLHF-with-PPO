In contrast, the remote control is a more novel and complex stimulus, and the child is less likely to experience a prolonged exposure to it, which would result in a weaker unconditioned response.

These expectations can be influenced by past experiences and learning. In the case of a child acquiring a conditioned response of fear to a small insect, the child may have had negative experiences with insects in the past, which can lead to an increased expectation of danger.
