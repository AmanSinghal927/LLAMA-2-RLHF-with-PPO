As a result, copper accumulates in the liver and other organs, leading to liver damage and other symptoms. The serum copper level is typically low in Wilson's disease because the liver, which normally regulates copper levels, is unable to release copper into the bloodstream.\n\n", "output3": "\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because WILSON disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes a deficiency of copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7B) in the liver, which leads to low levels of ceruloplasmin and high levels of copper in the blood and urine. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Low urinary copper.\n\n"}, {"question": "An 18-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his babysitter because of lethargy and fever for 3 hours.

The jejunum is the middle section of the small intestine and is particularly well-suited for the absorption of fatty acids.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Long chain fatty acids are mainly absorbed in the colon because the colon is the site of the majority of the absorption of dietary fats.

The blue color in the water is due to the presence of organic matter, and the amount of bleaching powder required to disinfect the water can be calculated by multiplying the amount of organic matter present in the water by a factor of 10. In this case, the amount of organic matter present in the water is 4 cups, so the required amount of bleaching powder is 4 x 10 = 40 gm.
