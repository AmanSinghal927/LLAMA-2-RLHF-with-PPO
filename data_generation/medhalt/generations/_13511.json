Additionally, the base of the lung is where the respiratory muscles are located, which helps to expand the lung and increase its distending capacity.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The distending capacity of the lung is maximum in the mid region because the lung tissue in this region is the most compliant, meaning it is able to stretch and expand the most with minimal resistance. This allows the lung to expand to its maximum volume without over-distending the tissue.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The distending capacity of the lung is maximum at the apex because the airway resistance is lowest at this point. As a result, the lung can expand to its maximum volume without any resistance.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The distending capacity of the lung is maximum at the posterior lobe because the airways in this region are longer and more vertical, allowing for a greater volume of air to be stored. Additionally, the posterior lobe is the most dependent part of the lung, which allows for a greater volume of air to be present without over-expanding the lung.\n\n"}, {"question": "50 year old man, because of persistent pain in the right shoulder to the rehabilitation department for treatment.
