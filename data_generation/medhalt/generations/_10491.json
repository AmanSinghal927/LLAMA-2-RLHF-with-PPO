Additionally, ultrasound is safe and does not use ionizing radiation, which is important for newborns.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because a CT scan is the most appropriate test to evaluate the kidneys and bladder in a newborn child who is not passing urine for 36 hours. It provides a detailed image of the kidneys, bladder, and ureters, and can help identify any obstructions or abnormalities. Additionally, it is a non-invasive test and does not require any special preparation or sedation.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because cystoscopy allows for direct visualization of the bladder and urethra, which is essential for diagnosing and treating any obstructions or abnormalities in the urinary tract. Additionally, cystoscopy can help determine the cause of urinary retention or incontinence in a newborn child.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because X\u2013ray pelvis is the most sensitive test for detecting urinary tract obstruction, which is the most common cause of newborns not passing urine for 36 hours.\n\n"}, {"question": "When we affirm that a test is valid we are referring to its scores:", "correct_answer": "They are precise.", "options": ["A)They serve for the intended purposes.", "B)They are stable.", "C)They lack random error.", "D)They are precise."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:When we affirm that a test is valid we are referring to its scores:A)They serve for the intended purposes.
