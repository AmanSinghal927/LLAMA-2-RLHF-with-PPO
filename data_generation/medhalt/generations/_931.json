The cytotrophoblasts invade the extracellular matrix of the chorion laeve, and this process is known as the \"invasion of the maternal-fetal interface\" or \"placental invasion\". Therefore, the correct answer is B)D capularis.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Cytotrophoblasts invade the parietal layer of the uterus, which is the layer of tissue that lines the uterus. Therefore, the correct answer is C)D parietalis.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Cytotrophoblasts do not invade the placenta. Instead, they differentiate into the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms the outer layer of the placenta and is responsible for nutrient exchange and waste removal.\n\n"}, {"question": "A child who was normal at bih develops chronic liver failure and muscle weakness at 3 months of age.

The increased glycogen in the liver on biopsy supports this diagnosis. Glucose-6-phosphatase is the enzyme responsible for the final step of glycogen synthesis, and its deficiency would result in the accumulation of glycogen in the liver and muscles, leading to the symptoms seen in this child.
