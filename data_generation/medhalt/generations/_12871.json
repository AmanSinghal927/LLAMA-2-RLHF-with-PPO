It is particularly useful when the data is continuous and the sample sizes are small. The test compares the sample means to a known population mean, and calculates the probability that the observed difference between the sample means could have occurred by chance. If the probability is less than a certain significance level (usually 0.05), then the difference between the sample means is considered to be statistically significant.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, the two variables are the means of the two groups.
