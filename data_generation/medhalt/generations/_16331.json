It is caused by a mutation in the KCNJ1 gene, which codes for the potassium channel subunit GIRK2.

The increased alkalosis can cause hypertension.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Gitelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the renal tubules and causes hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypertension. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the potassium-chloride cotransporter in the renal tubules, which leads to a loss of potassium ions and an excess of chloride ions in the urine. This results in a metabolic alkalosis with a high pH and a low potassium level. The hypertension is due to the increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n"}, {"question": "Topical administration of I% Pilocarpine failed to produce pupillary constriction in a patient who had a large, dilated pupil What should be the most probable reason?", "correct_answer": "Diabetic III nerve palsy", "options": ["A)Pharmacological blockade", "B)Uncal herniation", "C)Diabetic III nerve palsy", "D)Adie's tonic pupil"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Topical administration of I% Pilocarpine failed to produce pupillary constriction in a patient who had a large, dilated pupil What should be the most probable reason?A)Pharmacological blockade B)Uncal herniation C)Diabetic III nerve palsy D)Adie's tonic pupil\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agent that stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system and increases the tone of the ciliary muscle, leading to constriction of the pupil.
