B)Concentration in the solution. C)Sequence of base pairs. D)Linear or circular shape.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The electrophoretic mobility of a DNA fragment is influenced by the content of GC pairs because GC pairs have a higher mobility than AT pairs. This is because the larger size of GC pairs results in a higher charge density, which increases the electrophoretic mobility.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the concentration of the DNA fragment affects the movement of ions in the electrophoresis medium, and the movement of ions is what drives the separation of the DNA fragments based on their size.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The sequence of base pairs in a DNA fragment determines the electrophoretic mobility of the fragment. The mobility is influenced by the GC content, the length of the fragment, and the presence of secondary structures.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The electrophoretic mobility of a DNA fragment is affected by its linear or circular shape because the fragment's size and shape influence its interaction with the electrophoresis medium, such as agarose or polyacrylamide. A linear fragment will have a greater mobility than a circular fragment of the same size, because the linear fragment has a greater surface area in contact with the medium.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 40 year-old woman with a left breast tumor treatment.
