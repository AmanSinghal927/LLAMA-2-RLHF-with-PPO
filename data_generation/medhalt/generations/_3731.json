This is consistent with the appearance of B lymphocytes, which are characterized by the expression of the B lymphocyte marker CD20. The high proliferation index (>99%) and the presence of a lymph node enlargement are also consistent with the diagnosis of B lymphocyte proliferation.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The structure indicated by the arrows in the photomicrograph is most likely a macrophage because it has a characteristic \"eosinophilic\" appearance with a distinct nucleus and a prominent nucleolus, which are features of macrophages.

The presence of numerous CD20-positive B cells and the absence of CD43-positive macrophages and CD68-positive neutrophils support this diagnosis.

The nucleus of the neutrophil is characteristically lobulated, and the cytoplasm is densely granular.
