This is because the succedaneous permanent teeth are designed to last for a lifetime, and therefore, they need to be larger and stronger to withstand the forces of biting and chewing over a long period of time. In contrast, the deciduous teeth are only temporary and are designed to be smaller and lighter in order to accommodate the smaller jaw size of children.\n\n"}, {"question": "Epidermal nevus follows ?", "correct_answer": "Langer's lines", "options": ["A)Lymphatics", "B)Langer's lines", "C)Blaschko's lines", "D)Vasculature"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Epidermal nevus follows ?A)Lymphatics B)Langer's lines C)Blaschko's lines D)Vasculature\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because epidermal nevi are usually associated with lymphatic vessels and are thought to be caused by lymphatic dysfunction.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Langer's lines are the irregularly shaped, linear or longitudinal channels that run along the dermo-epidermal junction and are the sites of epidermal nevus formation.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Blaschko's lines are the irregular, wavy lines that appear on the skin, often in the context of epidermal nevi.
