The larger the diameter of the axon, the longer the refractory potential will last.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the diameter of an axon determines the number of ion channels that can be opened, which in turn affects the magnitude of the resting potential. A larger diameter axon has more ion channels and a larger resting potential, while a smaller diameter axon has fewer ion channels and a smaller resting potential.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The overshoot of an action potential is directly proportional to the diameter of the axon. The larger the diameter of the axon, the greater the overshoot of the action potential. This is because the larger axon has a larger capacitance, which allows the action potential to propagate more quickly and with greater amplitude.\n\n"}, {"question": "True about enameloma", "correct_answer": "Tumor of ameloblast which fail to differentiate terminally", "options": ["A)True neoplasm of ameloblast", "B)Tumor of ameloblast which fail to differentiate terminally", "C)A globule like structure usually found on root due to misplaced ameloblast", "D)Tumor resembling enamel present on gingiva"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:True about enamelomaA)True neoplasm of ameloblast B)Tumor of ameloblast which fail to differentiate terminally C)A globule like structure usually found on root due to misplaced ameloblast D)Tumor resembling enamel present on gingiva\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because enameloma is a true neoplasm of ameloblastic origin, which means it is a benign tumor that arises from the ameloblasts, the cells responsible for producing enamel.
