It is the most common cause of breast enlargement in girls under the age of 10.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Thelarche is a condition where the breasts enlarge due to hormonal changes that occur after menopause. During menopause, the levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones decrease, which can cause the breasts to shrink. However, some women may experience a resurgence of breast growth after menopause due to the increased levels of these hormones during hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This condition is known as thelarche.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Thelarche is a term used to describe the physiological breast enlargement that occurs in pregnancy due to the hormonal changes that take place during this time. The hormones estrogen and progesterone cause the breast tissue to grow and mature in preparation for lactation. This is a normal and temporary process that occurs in most pregnant women.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: That's correct because thelarche is a term used to describe the enlargement of the breasts in prepubescent boys, typically during puberty. It is caused by an increase in the amount of fat and glandular tissue in the breasts, and is a normal part of male development.\n\n"}, {"question": "Ptyalism is seen in:", "correct_answer": "Homer syndrome", "options": ["A)Frey's syndrome", "B)Mental retardation", "C)Sjogren's syndrome", "D)Homer syndrome"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Ptyalism is seen in:A)Frey's syndrome B)Mental retardation C)Sjogren's syndrome D)Homer syndrome\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because Ptyalism is a rare condition characterized by excessive salivation, and Frey's syndrome is a rare condition that can cause excessive salivation, among other symptoms.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Ptyalism is a rare condition in which there is excessive salivation, and it is often associated with mental retardation.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Ptyalism is a symptom of Sjogren's syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands, including the salivary glands.

This process takes place when a T cell expresses a specific T cell receptor (TCR) that can recognize and bind to self-MHC molecules. At this stage, the T cell undergoes a process called positive selection, which allows it to survive and mature into a functional T cell. The process of positive selection occurs in single-positive CD4+ T cells, but not in double-positive T cells.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Positive selection occurs during the double-positive stage of T cell development, when the T cell is still expressing both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. At this stage, the T cell is able to interact with both CD4 and CD8 ligands, and it undergoes positive selection if it can bind to both ligands.
