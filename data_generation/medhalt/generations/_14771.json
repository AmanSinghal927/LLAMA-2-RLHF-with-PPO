Lateral incisor C)Mand. central incisor D)Mand. second premolar\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot> A: The mandibular first premolar is the most commonly affected tooth in microdontia. This is because the mandible is the largest bone in the skull and the mandibular first premolar is located in the anterior region of the mandible, which is more prone to developmental abnormalities. Additionally, the mandibular first premolar is a critical tooth for mastication and occlusion, so any abnormalities in its development can have a significant impact on the individual's oral health and function.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Microdontia is a condition where teeth are smaller than normal. The maxillary lateral incisor is the tooth that is most commonly affected by microdontia. This is because the lateral incisor is the smallest tooth in the mouth and is therefore more susceptible to microdontia.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Microdontia is a developmental anomaly characterized by small size of teeth. The mandibular central incisor is the most commonly affected tooth, as it is the most posterior and the last to erupt in the dental arch.
