If the spacing is within this range, it is considered normal and no treatment is necessary.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because Hawley's appliance is a type of functional appliance that can help correct the spacing between maxillary incisors. It works by applying pressure to the teeth and jaw to guide the teeth into a more ideal position.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because the spacing between maxillary incisors is best corrected with a fixed appliance, such as a brace or a set of aligners, which can apply continuous pressure over a period of time to move the teeth into the desired position.
