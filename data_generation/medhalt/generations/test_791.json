This allows the individual to experience the desired behavior without an immediate reward, which can help to increase the likelihood of the behavior being maintained over time.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because a fading technique involves gradually reducing the amount of reinforcement received for a desired behavior, in order to extinguish the behavior. By decreasing the number of chips needed to earn reinforcers, the program is providing less reinforcement for the target behavior, which will eventually lead to the behavior being extinguished.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Introducing a fading technique in a chip economy program would decrease the time between the execution of the behavior and the delivery of the cards, as the program would gradually reduce the amount of time between the behavior and the reward, allowing the individual to learn faster.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the introduction of a fading technique in a chip economy program would involve delivering the cards at random immediately after the execution of the target behaviors, rather than at a fixed schedule or based on the number of chips earned.

To do this, the studies must have equivalent results, meaning they must measure the same thing in the same way.
