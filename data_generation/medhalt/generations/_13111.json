However, it is not always possible for the apical 1/3rd to resorb completely, leaving a residual root. This can cause problems during extraction.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: During extraction, the apical 1/3rd of the tooth may be subjected to excessive forces, leading to fracture. This is particularly true for primary teeth, which are more prone to fracture due to their smaller size and weaker roots.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: The problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth is that during resorption, apical 1/3rd may remain unresorbed, and during extraction, fracture of apical 1/3rd may be there.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: The answer is D)None because there is no problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth.
