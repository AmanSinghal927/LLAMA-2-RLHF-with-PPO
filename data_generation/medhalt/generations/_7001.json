He wants to change sex and have vagina. It comes under?A)Sexual maturation B)Dual role transvestism C)Transsexualism D)Gender dysphoria\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the individual is not happy with their gender and wants to change it, which is a common aspect of sexual maturation.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: I apologize for the mistake. The correct answer is actually D)Gender dysphoria.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because transsexualism is a condition where a person experiences gender dysphoria and seeks to change their biological sex through hormone therapy and/or gender-affirming surgeries. The person may experience distress due to the incongruence between their gender identity and their biological sex.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences distress and discomfort due to the gender they were assigned at birth not aligning with their gender identity.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children with a first UTI receive prophylactic antibiotics for at least 4-6 months.
