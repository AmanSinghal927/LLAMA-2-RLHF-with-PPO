The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women with preeclampsia be delivered at 37 weeks or earlier if they have any of the following: severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, or gestational hypertension with significant proteinuria. In this case, the patient has proteinuria and mild preeclampsia, which meets the criteria for delivery at 37 weeks.
