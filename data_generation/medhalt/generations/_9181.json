This bond is achieved through the substitution of eugenol by EBA in zinc eugenol cement, which increases its strength. Polycarboxylate cement also undergoes a similar chemical reaction, but with the use of polyacrylic acid instead of eugenol.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Polyacrylic acid is liquid because it is a water-soluble polymer.\n\n"}, {"question": "Phrenic nerve chiefly supplies?", "correct_answer": "Stomach", "options": ["A)Ileum", "B)Diaphragm", "C)Stomach", "D)Oesophagus"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Phrenic nerve chiefly supplies?A)Ileum B)Diaphragm C)Stomach D)Oesophagus\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The phrenic nerve chiefly supplies the diaphragm, which is a muscle that helps with breathing.
