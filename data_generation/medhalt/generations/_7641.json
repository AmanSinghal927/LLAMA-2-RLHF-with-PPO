This zone is responsible for the maintenance of the cartilage surface and is constantly being replaced by new cells.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: In Aicular cartilage, the most active chondrocytes are found in Zone 3 because it is the zone where the cartilage is most avascular and has the highest metabolic activity.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because in Zone 1, the cartilage is the most avascular, which means it has the least amount of blood flow. As a result, the chondrocytes in Zone 1 are more active and produce more matrix material.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: In Aicular cartilage, most active chondrocytes are found in Zone 2 because this is the area where the cartilage is most exposed to mechanical stress and therefore requires the most maintenance and repair.\n\n"}, {"question": "Under normal metabolic conditions, erythrocytes accumulate:", "correct_answer": "NADPH.", "options": ["A)Lactate", "B)Citrate.", "C)Fosfoenolpiruvato.", "D)NADPH."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Under normal metabolic conditions, erythrocytes accumulate:A)Lactate B)Citrate.
