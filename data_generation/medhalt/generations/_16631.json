What is the next step in the management of this patient?\n<bot>: The next step in the management of this patient would be to perform an emergency cholecystectomy to remove the gallbladder. This is because acute cholecystitis is a surgical emergency and delays in treatment can lead to serious complications such as gangrene, perforation, and sepsis.
