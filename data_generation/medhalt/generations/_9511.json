This increase in neurotransmitter activity can prolong the latency period, leading to the observed change in the latent period.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The latent period of REM sleep is not affected by depression. Depression does not cause a change in the latency of REM sleep.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because patients with REM sleep disorder have a reduced or absent latent period, which is the time between the onset of REM sleep and the beginning of the first REM sleep episode. This is due to the dysfunction of the brain's REM sleep regulation system.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The latent period of REM sleep is shortened in patients with depression because of the increased activity in the brain's noradrenergic system, which leads to a decrease in the amount of time spent in NREM sleep and an increase in the amount of time spent in REM sleep.\n\n"}, {"question": "The figure below shows a facial trauma patients to the emergency, emergency physicians CT arrange face, facial bone fractures situation there, it hurt the case classified as:", "correct_answer": "Right Le Fort II + III, left Le Fort I", "options": ["A)Right Le Fort I + III, left Le Fort II", "B)Right Le Fort I + II, left Le Fort IV", "C)Right Le Fort I + II, left Le Fort III", "D)Right Le Fort II + III, left Le Fort I"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:The figure below shows a facial trauma patients to the emergency, emergency physicians CT arrange face, facial bone fractures situation there, it hurt the case classified as:A)Right Le Fort I + III, left Le Fort II B)Right Le Fort I + II, left Le Fort IV C)Right Le Fort I + II, left Le Fort III D)Right Le Fort II + III, left Le Fort I\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the facial bone fractures shown in the figure are consistent with a right Le Fort I + III and left Le Fort II injury.
