The slots and coves provide a means for the inlay to be seated and held in place within the tooth. The presence of contra bevels can also contribute to the retention of the inlay, but the preparation of slots and coves is the primary factor.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because contra bevels can interfere with the retention of the inlay, making it more difficult to remove the provisional restoration.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The near parallel axial walls help to retain the inlay by preventing the marginal ridge from being pushed out of the preparation during chewing forces.\n\n"}, {"question": "Golgi bodies function as:", "correct_answer": "Protein synthesis", "options": ["A)None of the above", "B)Protein synthesis", "C)Protein lipid synthesis", "D)Sorting of glycoproteins"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Golgi bodies function as:A)None of the above B)Protein synthesis C)Protein lipid synthesis D)Sorting of glycoproteins\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Golgi bodies are not involved in protein synthesis, they are involved in the processing and modification of proteins and lipids that have already been synthesized.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the Golgi apparatus is responsible for the synthesis of proteins and the modification of lipids.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because the Golgi apparatus is responsible for the synthesis of proteins and lipids.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Golgi bodies function as a sorting and processing center for proteins and lipids.
