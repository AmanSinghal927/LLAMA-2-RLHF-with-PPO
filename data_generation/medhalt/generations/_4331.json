This results in a decrease in lung volume and a decrease in the amount of oxygen that can be taken in.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Type IV respiratory failure occurs when there is an accumulation of fluid in the alveoli, which prevents the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air.
