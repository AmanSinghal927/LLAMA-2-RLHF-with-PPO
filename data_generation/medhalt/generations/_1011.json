The movement of water is driven by the concentration gradient of solutes, and the membrane only allows water molecules to pass through, not solutes. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Filtration.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Facilitated dissemination is a process of transporting water and solutes through a selectively permeable membrane, which depends on the concentration gradient of solutes. In other words, water and solutes move down their concentration gradient, and the membrane allows the passage of water and solutes based on their concentration gradient. This process is essential for maintaining the balance of fluids and solutes within cells and tissues.\n\n"}, {"question": "Calcification of roots of deciduous teeth is completed by:", "correct_answer": "2 years", "options": ["A)4 years", "B)6 years", "C)2 years", "D)8 years"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Calcification of roots of deciduous teeth is completed by:A)4 years B)6 years C)2 years D)8 years\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because calcification of roots of deciduous teeth is completed by the age of 4 years.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Calcification of roots of deciduous teeth is completed by the age of 6 years because the roots of deciduous teeth are formed before the teeth erupt into the mouth, and the calcification process takes place gradually over several years.
