The Norwood procedure involves a series of surgical steps that are designed to redirect the blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and to close the ventricular septal defect. This approach has been shown to have a high success rate and to reduce the need for additional surgeries in the future.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The Rastelli surgical approach is currently the best surgical approach for neonates with tetralogy of Fallot because it is associated with lower early and late mortality rates compared to other surgical techniques.
