This is because the nerve that innervates the esophageal muscles also innervates the posterior tongue, and the symptoms of difficulty swallowing and regurgitation of undigested food are consistent with dysfunction of the posterior tongue.", "output3": "\n<bot>: The answer is correct because the nerve responsible for motor innervation of the affected muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) is also responsible for parasympathetic innervation of the AV node.
