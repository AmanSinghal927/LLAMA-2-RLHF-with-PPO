In patients with multiple myeloma, the TTR protein can become misfolded and form amyloid fibrils, which can deposit in various organs, including the kidneys. The presence of proteinuria and a kidney biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis of TTR amyloidosis.\n\n", "output3": "\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: In multiple myeloma, the most common type of renal amyloid deposition is AL amyloid.

Captopril is also not recommended as it can cause angioedema. Enalapril is a good choice.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Captopril is a more potent ACE inhibitor than other options, and it is more likely to be safe in renal failure because it has a shorter half-life and is less likely to accumulate in the body. Additionally, captopril has been shown to have a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile in patients with renal impairment compared to other ACE inhibitors.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Enalapril is metabolized by the liver, and its active metabolite is excreted primarily in the urine.
