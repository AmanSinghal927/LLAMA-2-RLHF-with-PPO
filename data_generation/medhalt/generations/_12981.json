The patient's serum potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L is elevated and could be causing the patient's confusion and weakness.

Additionally, the patient's laboratory values show evidence of renal impairment, which is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus.

The laboratory values of urea nitrogen and creatinine are elevated, confirming the diagnosis of end-stage renal disease. Lactulose is a medication that can help to reduce the risk of uremic encephalopathy by reducing the amount of urea in the blood.
