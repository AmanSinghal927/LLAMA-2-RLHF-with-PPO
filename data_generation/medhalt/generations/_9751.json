It is caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene, which codes for a protein that is essential for the structure and function of basement membranes. The hearing loss in Alport syndrome is typically bilateral, high-frequency sensorineural, and progressive. The anterior lenticonus, which is a characteristic feature of the disorder, is also consistent with Alport syndrome. Tuberous sclerosis (B) and Von Hippel-Lindau disease (C) are also genetic disorders, but they do not typically cause hearing loss or lenticonus. Fabry\u2019s disease (D) is a lysosomal storage disorder that can cause hearing loss, but it is not typically associated with lenticonus.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the patient has a history of a renal transplant in his father, and the patient has bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is a common feature of tuberous sclerosis.

It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to the accumulation of lipids in the lysosomes of affected cells. This accumulation can cause progressive damage to the kidneys, leading to renal failure, and can also cause hearing loss and vision loss. The high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and anterior lenticonus seen in this patient are both common features of Fabry\u2019s disease.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which amino acid is not involved in transamination -", "correct_answer": "Histidine", "options": ["A)Aspaate", "B)Histidine", "C)Alanine", "D)Lysine"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which amino acid is not involved in transamination -A)Aspaate B)Histidine C)Alanine D)Lysine\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Aspartate is not involved in transamination because it is not an alpha-amino acid.
