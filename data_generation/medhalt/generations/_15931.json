The absence of obvious polymorphism and the presence of dense mesenchymal cells in the subcutaneous layer also support this diagnosis. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and pseudocyst are less likely diagnoses, as they are typically associated with more complex architectural patterns and are less common in the pancreas. Serous cystadenoma is also less likely, as it is typically associated with a more solid appearance and is less common in the pancreas.\n\n"}, {"question": "Physiological antagonists are ?", "correct_answer": "All of the above", "options": ["A)Adrenaline and Isoprenaline", "B)Isoprenaline and propranolal", "C)All of the above", "D)Histamine and adrenaline"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Physiological antagonists are ?A)Adrenaline and Isoprenaline B)Isoprenaline and propranolal C)All of the above D)Histamine and adrenaline\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Physiological antagonists are substances that counteract or oppose the effects of other substances in the body. Adrenaline and isoprenaline have opposing effects on the body, with adrenaline causing the heart to beat faster and isoprenaline slowing down the heart rate. Therefore, they are physiological antagonists.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Isoprenaline and propranolal are both adrenergic agonists, which means they increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. However, isoprenaline has a shorter duration of action and is more potent than propranolal. This makes isoprenaline a physiological antagonist of propranolal, as it can counteract the effects of propranolal and increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system again.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Physiological antagonists are substances that counteract the effects of other substances in the body. In this case, the options listed are all physiological antagonists of each other. Adrenaline and isoprenaline are both stimulants that increase heart rate and blood pressure, but they have different mechanisms of action. Isoprenaline works by binding to beta-2 receptors, while adrenaline works by binding to alpha-1 receptors. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that blocks the effects of isoprenaline and adrenaline by binding to beta-1 receptors. Therefore, all three options are physiological antagonists of each other.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because histamine and adrenaline are both physiological antagonists, meaning they have opposite effects on the body. Histamine is released during allergic reactions and causes blood vessels to dilate, while adrenaline is released during the \"fight or flight\" response and causes blood vessels to constrict. So, when histamine and adrenaline are present together, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net neutral effect on the body.\n\n"}, {"question": "Advantage of formoterol over salmeterol is ?", "correct_answer": "It is a sho acting beta 2 agonist", "options": ["A)It can be used for prophylaxis in asthmatics", "B)It is a sho acting beta 2 agonist", "C)It also has beta 1 agonistic action", "D)It has got a faster onset of action"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Advantage of formoterol over salmeterol is ?A)It can be used for prophylaxis in asthmatics B)It is a sho acting beta 2 agonist C)It also has beta 1 agonistic action D)It has got a faster onset of action\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Formoterol has a longer duration of action compared to salmeterol, which makes it more suitable for prophylaxis.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Formoterol is a short acting beta 2 agonist, which means it has a faster onset of action compared to salmeterol, which is a long acting beta 2 agonist.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Formoterol has both beta 2 agonist and beta 1 agonist activities, which makes it more effective in the treatment of asthma and COPD compared to salmeterol, which only has beta 2 agonist activity.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Formoterol has a shorter t1/2 and faster onset of action compared to salmeterol, which means it starts working sooner and has a more rapid bronchodilator effect.\n\n"}, {"question": "Immunofluorescence staining pattern from a kidney biopsy from a 35-year-old patient presenting with proteinuria has been shown below.
