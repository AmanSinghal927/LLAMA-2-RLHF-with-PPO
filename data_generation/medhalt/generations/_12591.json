Cell granules, such as lysosomes or secretory granules, can cause an increase in forward scatter due to their size and refractive index. Therefore, the presence of cell granules can be detected by analyzing the forward scatter pattern.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Forward scatter in flow cytometry is used to assess cell death because it is a measure of the size and complexity of cells, and cells that are undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death) will have a higher forward scatter than healthy cells.
