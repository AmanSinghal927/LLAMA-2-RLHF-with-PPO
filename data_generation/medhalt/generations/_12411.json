B)Common destiny C)Likeness. D)Good continuation.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Perceptual grouping is based on the principle of parsimony, which states that the human brain tends to perceive elements that move together as a single perceptual unit. This principle is based on the idea that the brain prefers simpler, more efficient explanations for perceptual experiences. When elements move together in a consistent pattern, the brain assumes that they are part of the same perceptual unit, rather than separate entities.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The principle of perceptual grouping based on common destiny states that elements that move together in a consistent manner are perceived as a single perceptual unit. This is because the brain assumes that the elements are part of the same object or event if they move together in a consistent manner.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Perceptual grouping is based on the principle of likeness, which states that elements that are similar in form, color, texture, or other visual features are perceived as belonging together. When elements move together in a consistent pattern, they are perceived as a single unit because they are similar in their movement.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When elements are presented with the same pattern of movement, they are perceived as the same perceptual unit because our visual system is wired to group elements that move together in a coherent manner.
