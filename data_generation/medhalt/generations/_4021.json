Non-rigid fixation is the most appropriate option for adequate bone buttressing, as it allows for the natural motion of the joint and promotes the healing process.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because in the presence of adequate bone buttressing, the AO system of fixation aims to distribute the load across multiple points, rather than relying on a single point of fixation, which is the principle of load sharing. This allows for a more stable and secure fixation, while also promoting bone healing and avoiding excessive stress on the surrounding bone.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because the AO system of fixation is designed to provide compression and stimulate osteogenesis, which is the formation of new bone tissue. When adequate bone buttressing is present, the AO system can be used to provide a stable and rigid fixation while also promoting bone healing.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: When adequate bone buttressing is present, the AO system of fixation suggests load bearing fixation because the bone is able to bear the weight of the implant and the surrounding tissue, reducing the risk of implant failure or loosening.\n\n"}, {"question": "ST Segment of ECG corresponds to which phase of action potential ?", "correct_answer": "Phase III", "options": ["A)Phase II", "B)Phase III", "C)Phase I", "D)Phase 0"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:ST Segment of ECG corresponds to which phase of action potential ?A)Phase II B)Phase III C)Phase I D)Phase 0\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because ST segment is the phase of the action potential where the membrane potential of the cardiac cells is most negative, and it occurs after the rapid depolarization of the QRS complex and before the repolarization of the T wave.
