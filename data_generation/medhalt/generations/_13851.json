This process is mediated by the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) protein, which is expressed in the brush border of the proximal tubular cells. The SGLT2 protein uses the energy from the cell to pump glucose molecules from the filtrate into the bloodstream, bypassing the renal tubular cells.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Glucose molecules are reabsorbed by the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules through the process of cellular autophagy (phagocytosis), which is a mechanism of cellular recycling that allows the cell to degrade and recycle damaged or excess cellular components.
