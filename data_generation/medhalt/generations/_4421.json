Which of following drug can be prescribed to him?A)Penicillin G B)Sulfasalazine C)Streptomycin D)Sulfisoxazole\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because Penicillin G is the only option that is not a beta-lactam antibiotic, and therefore is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in a patient with a history of penicillin allergy. The other options (Sulfasalazine, Streptomycin, and Sulfisoxazole) are all beta-lactam antibiotics and may cause a similar allergic reaction.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because in patients with a history of allergic reactions to penicillin, it is generally recommended to avoid other beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G. Sulfasalazine, being a sulfa drug, is not a beta-lactam antibiotic and is less likely to cause an allergic reaction.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Streptomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against many bacteria, including those that cause rheumatic fever. However, it is not a penicillin and therefore is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in someone who is hypersensitive to penicillin.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Sulfisoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction than penicillin, which is the most likely cause of the patient's hypersensitivity.\n\n"}, {"question": "A reaction in which a single raw material can produce two or more stereoisomeric products, but produces one of them in greater quantity than any other, is known as:", "correct_answer": "Diastereospecific.", "options": ["A)Enantiospecific.", "B)Chiral.", "C)Stereoselective.", "D)Diastereospecific."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:A reaction in which a single raw material can produce two or more stereoisomeric products, but produces one of them in greater quantity than any other, is known as:A)Enantiospecific.

In this case, the reaction is stereoselective, meaning that one of the stereoisomers is produced in greater quantity than any other. However, the term \"chiral\" is more general and refers to the fact that the reactants have different stereochemistry, regardless of the stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because a stereoselective reaction is one in which one of the stereoisomers is produced in greater quantity than any other, despite the fact that both stereoisomers are possible products of the reaction.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because in a diastereoselective reaction, one of the stereoisomers is formed in greater quantity than any other, even though both stereoisomers are produced.\n\n"}, {"question": "Light transmitting wedges transmit:", "correct_answer": "70-80% of incident light", "options": ["A)85-90% of incident light", "B)70-80% of incident light", "C)80-85% of incident light", "D)90-95% of incident light"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Light transmitting wedges transmit:A)85-90% of incident light B)70-80% of incident light C)80-85% of incident light D)90-95% of incident light\n\nA:", "output1": "\n\n", "output2": "\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because light transmitting wedges are designed to transmit a high percentage of light, but not all of it.
