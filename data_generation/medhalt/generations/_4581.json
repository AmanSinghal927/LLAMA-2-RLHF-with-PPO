The limited abduction of the shoulder and the patient holding the arm against the abdomen are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, loss of sensation over the lateral forearm would be expected.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The patient's description of a \"popping\" sensation and immediate, sharp pain at his left shoulder suggests a possible fracture or dislocation of the shoulder. The limited abduction of the arm and reduced muscle tone over the shoulder also support this diagnosis.
