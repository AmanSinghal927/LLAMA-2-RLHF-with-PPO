C)It supposes an improvement of the stability of the active principle when increasing the specific surface. D)It implies an increase in solubility and, therefore, an increase in oral bioavailability.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: When the particle size of an active ingredient is reduced by spraying, the surface area of the particles increases, which means that the specific surface area of the material also increases. This increase in specific surface area can lead to a decrease in the solubility of the active ingredient, as well as a decrease in the speed of dissolution, according to the general equation of Noyes and Whitney.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: According to the general equation of Noyes and Whitney, the specific surface area of a powder is directly related to the rate of dissolution. As the particle size of the powder is reduced by spraying, the specific surface area increases, which leads to an increase in the speed of dissolution. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: According to the general equation of Noyes and Whitney, the rate of dissolution of a solid is directly proportional to the surface area of the solid. Therefore, when the particle size is reduced, the surface area of the solid increases, which leads to an improvement in the stability of the active principle.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: When the particle size of an active ingredient is reduced by spraying, the specific surface area of the material increases. This increase in specific surface area can lead to an increase in solubility, as there is a greater surface area available for dissolution. As a result, the active ingredient is more readily soluble in the formulation, which can lead to an increase in oral bioavailability. The general equation of Noyes and Whitney is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between the particle size of a material and its dissolution rate.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 42-year-old man presents to a neurologist for evaluation of severe headache.
