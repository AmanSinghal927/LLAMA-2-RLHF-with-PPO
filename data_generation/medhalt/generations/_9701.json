The influenza vaccine is relatively inexpensive and widely available, making it a more accessible option for this patient.\n<human>: That makes sense. But why is it important to emphasize smoking cessation in this patient?\n<bot>: Smoking cessation is important for this patient because smoking can exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as bronchitis and emphysema, and can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer.
