It involves addressing the root causes of the problem, such as poverty, lack of education, and social isolation, and providing support and resources to families and communities to help them raise healthy children. By addressing these underlying issues, we can prevent children from being drawn into harmful lifestyles in the first place.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Mass strategy is a population-level approach that aims to discourage children from adopting harmful lifestyles by targeting a large number of individuals at once.
