However, it also inhibits the enzyme GABA transaminase, which is responsible for breaking down GABA. By inhibiting this enzyme, vigabatrin increases the amount of GABA available for use in the brain, leading to its antiepileptic effect.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because vigabatrin binds to GABA receptors and activates them, thereby increasing the activity of GABA.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Vigabatrin is a hard analog of GABA because it has a similar structure to GABA, but it is not metabolized by GABA transaminase. Instead, it is accumulated in the brain and acts as a GABA mimetic, potentiating the activity of endogenous GABA.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because vigabatrin is converted to GABA in the brain, and GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of pain and weakness in her left leg that started 2 days ago while running a marathon.
