Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone are both glucocorticoids, which are used to replace the patient's deficient adrenal hormones.

Intravenous fludrocortisone is the next best step in the management of this patient because it is a potent mineralocorticoid that can help to increase the patient's blood pressure and improve his electrolyte imbalance. Androgen replacement therapy is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with hypogonadism.
