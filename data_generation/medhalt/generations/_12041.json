In Turner's syndrome, the fusion of the poles of the kidneys is a result of the absence of the superior mesenteric artery, which normally separates the kidneys and allows them to ascend to their normal position.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The inferior mesenteric artery is a branch of the aorta that supplies blood to the lower abdominal organs, including the kidneys. In Turner's syndrome, the inferior mesenteric artery is often fused with the renal artery, which can prevent the normal ascension of the kidneys during embryological development.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The splenic artery is a branch of the celiac artery, and it courses inferiorly and laterally to the kidneys. In Turner's syndrome, the fusion of the poles of the kidneys is caused by the absence of the Y chromosome, which leads to a failure of the normal ascension of the kidneys during embryological development. The splenic artery is one of the anatomical structures that would prevent the normal ascension of the kidneys.\n\n"}, {"question": "22-year-old women presents to the emergency depament with a chief complaint of severe left upper quadrant pain after being punched by her husband.
