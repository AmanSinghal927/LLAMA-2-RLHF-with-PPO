The MHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and present the antigens to T cells. The T cells recognize the antigens presented by the MHC molecules and migrate to the target tissue.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Selectina L is a molecule that participates in the extravasation of T lymphocytes to the target tissue by interacting with the integrin LFA-1 on the surface of the T cells and the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.

This means that the mother's immune system may not be able to mount an effective response to the disease, leading to a higher risk of complications and death for both the mother and the baby. Additionally, the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy can exacerbate the symptoms of MS, making it more difficult to manage the disease.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Eisenmenger's syndrome is a cyanotic congenital heart disease that is characterized by a left-to-right shunt at the atrial level, resulting in a blue color of the skin and mucous membranes due to the lack of oxygenation of the blood.
