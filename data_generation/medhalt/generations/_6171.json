The inability to move any part of the face on the right side is consistent with a stroke. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes increases the likelihood of a CVA. The next best step in management would be to elevate the head of the bed and intubate the patient to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

Elevation of the head of the bed and intubation (option A) may be necessary to ensure the patient's airway is secure and to reduce the risk of aspiration.

Tissue plasminogen activator is not appropriate, as it is used to treat acute ischemic stroke, not Bell's palsy.
