It has a half-life of approximately 4-5 hours, which means that the amount of TGF-B (beta) in the body decreases by half every 4-5 hours. This is because the protein is broken down by enzymes in the body, and it is not replaced at the same rate that it is produced.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: TGF-beta has a half-life of approximately 10-12 minutes in blood plasma.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: TGF-B (beta) is a latent protein that is activated by proteolytic cleavage.
