The increased RDW and indirect hyperbilirubinemia are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely finding on a blood smear would be the presence of dacrocytes, which are spherocytes that have undergone fragmentation.\n\n"}, {"question": "In relation to the liver transplant, indicate the following CORRECT:", "correct_answer": "Liver metastases from colon cancer are an approved indication for liver transplantation.", "options": ["A)The most frequent indication for liver transplantation today is cirrhosis due to B virus infection (HBV).", "B)The MELD system is a prognostic model that allows the prioritization for liver transplantation of patients on the list.", "C)Liver transplantation would be the best treatment option for a 45-year-old patient with diffuse hepatocarcinoma.", "D)Liver metastases from colon cancer are an approved indication for liver transplantation."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:In relation to the liver transplant, indicate the following CORRECT:A)The most frequent indication for liver transplantation today is cirrhosis due to B virus infection (HBV).
