Variation in sensitivity of response to different doses of a drug can be due to differences in bioavailability, as well as other factors such as individual differences in metabolism, transport, and target-site sensitivity.\n<human>: Okay, that makes sense. But how do we measure bioavailability?\n<bot>: Bioavailability can be measured using various methods, including pharmacokinetic studies, which involve measuring the concentration of the drug in the blood over time, and pharmacodynamic studies, which involve measuring the effect of the drug on a specific biological response.\n<human>: That's interesting. I didn't know there were different ways to measure bioavailability.\n<bot>: Yes, there are several methods, and the choice of method depends on the specific drug and the information needed.\n<human>: Thanks for explaining!
