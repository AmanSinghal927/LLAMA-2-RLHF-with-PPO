D)Saturation of the drug binding sites at the tissue level.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot> A: As the dose of drug increases, the dissolved fraction of drug in the body also increases, leading to non-linear kinetic behavior. This is because the rate of drug absorption and distribution is directly proportional to the dose of drug, but the rate of drug elimination is not necessarily proportional to the dose. As a result, the concentration of drug in the body may increase more rapidly at higher doses, leading to non-linear kinetic behavior.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because enzymatic autoinduction can lead to an increase in the rate of drug metabolism, which can result in non-linear kinetic behavior in the distribution of the drug.
