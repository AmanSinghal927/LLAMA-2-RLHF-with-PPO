These granulomas can cause the lung tissue to become thick and stiff, leading to the characteristic crackling sound when the lung is auscultated.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The presence of Velcro crackles at the lung base on auscultation is a sign of systemic lupus erythematosus because it is a manifestation of pulmonary involvement, which is a common feature of the disease.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Polyaeritisnodosa is a condition that causes inflammation and scarring in the lungs, which can lead to the presence of Velcro crackles on auscultation.
