B)During intense exercise, lactate dehydrogenase oxidizes pyruvate in excess to lactate. C)Creatine phosphate is a molecule with a low phosphoryl transfer potential. D)Alanine is used to transport nitrogen and carbon skeletons from the liver to the muscle.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: That's because at rest, the muscle's energy needs are met primarily by ATP that is stored in the muscle fibers. However, this ATP is only enough to maintain contraction for a short period of time, typically just a few seconds. After that, the muscle needs to rely on other energy sources, such as glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, to maintain contraction.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: During intense exercise, the muscle requires a large amount of ATP to maintain contraction. The ATP demand is higher than the ATP supply, so the muscle must use anaerobic metabolism to generate ATP. In this process, pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, which increases the amount of lactate produced.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Creatine phosphate is a high-energy compound that is stored in skeletal muscle and used to rapidly generate ATP during intense, short-duration activities. It has a low phosphoryl transfer potential because it is quickly converted to ATP and ADP during muscle contraction, rather than being stored for long periods of time.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because alanine is the only amino acid that can be taken up by the muscle through the bloodstream and converted into glucose, which is then used to fuel muscle contraction.\n\n"}, {"question": "25 maple syrup urine disease is a branched chain amino acid metabolism disorders.

Factors such as None and Both are not specific to MI and may be present in other cardiac conditions.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because regional wall motion abnormality and elevated troponin levels are both important indicators of myocardial infarction (MI).
