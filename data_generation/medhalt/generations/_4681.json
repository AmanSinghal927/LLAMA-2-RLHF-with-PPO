It involves close monitoring of the mother and the baby, with the goal of delivering the baby at 37-38 weeks of gestation. This method is preferred because it reduces the risk of bleeding and other complications compared to other methods.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because Crede's method is based on the principles of expectant management, which means closely monitoring the patient's condition and intervening only when necessary, rather than following a strict regimen. This approach is considered more appropriate for patients with placenta previa, as it allows for more flexibility in managing the condition.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The Brandt-Andrews method is a widely used regimen for expectant management of placenta previa, which involves close monitoring and serial ultrasound examinations to assess the progression of the placenta and the development of the fetus.
