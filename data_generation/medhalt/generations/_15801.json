Therefore, the most important rehabilitation disposal for such patients is to maintain passive shoulder range of motion and strengthen the shoulder abduction movement, which can help to improve the strength of the shoulder muscles and reduce the incidence of shoulder dislocation.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the shoulder strap (shoulder sling) can help to stabilize the shoulder joint and prevent further dislocation. Additionally, the shoulder strap can help to maintain the passive shoulder range of motion and prevent contracture.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the shoulder abduction angle is increased, the shoulder joint is more likely to be in a stable position, and the risk of subluxation is reduced.
