However, when glucose is not available, the brain can use amino acids as an alternative fuel source. Amino acids can be converted into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, which is why they are considered an alternate fuel source for the brain.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, and it is the only fuel source that can be used by the brain in significant amounts. The brain is highly dependent on glucose for its energy needs, and it is estimated that the brain consumes about 12% of the body's total energy expenditure.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The brain can use fatty acids as an alternate fuel source because it can be converted into energy in the form of ATP through beta-oxidation.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Ketone bodies are an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is not available.\n<human>"}, {"question": "Regarding daptomycin, which of the following statements is true ?:", "correct_answer": "It presents adverse reactions at the bone level.", "options": ["A)It has activity against gram-negative bacteria.", "B)It can be administered orally.", "C)It presents adverse reactions at the bone level.", "D)It is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Regarding daptomycin, which of the following statements is true ?:A)It has activity against gram-negative bacteria.

The irregular heart rhythm in this patient is likely due to an increased vagal tone, which is reduced by digoxin. Therefore, the decrease in heart rate after treatment with digoxin is due to vagal stimulation.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Digoxin is a medication that slows the heart rate by blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors on the heart. This causes a decrease in the heart rate and an increase in the time it takes for the ventricles to contract.

It does this by increasing the amount of calcium available within the heart muscle cells, which in turn increases the strength of the contractions. This is why it is used to treat heart failure. In this patient, the irregular heart rhythm is likely due to the fact that the drug is having its intended effect of increasing the force of contraction, but the heart is not able to coordinate the contractions in a regular manner.\n\n"}, {"question": "According to K\u00e9rouac and collaborators, within the paradigm of categorization and from the orientation \"to the disease\", the person:", "correct_answer": "It has the physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual components.", "options": ["A)Orient care according to your priorities.", "B)Does not participate in their care.", "C)It has the physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual components.", "D)You have the responsibility to change your situation."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:According to K\u00e9rouac and collaborators, within the paradigm of categorization and from the orientation \"to the disease\", the person:A)Orient care according to your priorities.
