Lithium has been shown to improve cognitive function and slow the progression of dementia in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which is a class of medications used to treat Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. It works by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain, which can improve cognitive function and memory. The patient's symptoms of impaired memory and poor orientation in space are consistent with mild cognitive impairment, and donepezil may be effective in improving these symptoms.
