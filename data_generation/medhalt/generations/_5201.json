Therefore, the disease is more common in females than in males.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects females almost exclusively. It is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Because the MECP2 gene is located on the X chromosome, the disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need to inherit one mutated copy of the MECP2 gene from each parent to develop the disease. Males, on the other hand, have only one X chromosome, so they need to inherit one mutated copy of the MECP2 gene from their mother and one normal copy from their father to develop the disease.

The GLA gene is located on the X chromosome, and the disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. This means that the disease is more common in males, who have only one X chromosome and therefore only one copy of the GLA gene, whereas females have two X chromosomes and may have a normal copy of the GLA gene that can compensate for the defective copy.\n\n"}, {"question": "8th and 9th rib costal cailage forms which type of joint?", "correct_answer": "Interchondral joint", "options": ["A)Costoveebral joint", "B)Synol joint", "C)Interchondral joint", "D)Costochondral joint"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:8th and 9th rib costal cailage forms which type of joint?A)Costoveebral joint B)Synol joint C)Interchondral joint D)Costochondral joint\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the 8th and 9th rib costal cartilages form a costoveebral joint, which is a type of synovial joint that allows for movement between the ribs and the vertebrae.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The 8th and 9th rib costal cartilage forms a synovial joint, which is a type of joint that allows for gliding movement between the bones.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the costal cage is formed by the ribs and the thoracic vertebrae, and the joint between them is an interchondral joint.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because the 8th and 9th rib costal cartilages form a joint with the costal cartilage of the ribs, which is a type of costochondral joint.\n\n"}, {"question": "Investigation of choice in post-menopausal bleeding is?", "correct_answer": "DC", "options": ["A)Fractional curettage", "B)PAP smear", "C)DC", "D)Colposcopy guided endometrial biopsy"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Investigation of choice in post-menopausal bleeding is?A)Fractional curettage B)PAP smear C)DC D)Colposcopy guided endometrial biopsy\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Fractional curettage is the most common and effective method for investigating post-menopausal bleeding.
