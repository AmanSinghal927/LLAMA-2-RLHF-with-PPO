D)Eluents are classified as strong and weak, depending on whether their eluent strength is low or high, respectively.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because a solvent with a lower retention factor will elute more quickly, which means that it has a greater eluent strength.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because in reverse phase chromatography, the stationary phase is a hydrophobic material, and the solvent (mobile phase) is a hydrophilic liquid. Therefore, the solvent (mobile phase) has a higher affinity for the stationary phase than the solute, which results in a lower retention factor for the solute.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because a lower modifier content means a higher proportion of water in the mobile phase, and water is a stronger solvent than the organic modifier. Therefore, the lower the modifier content, the higher the eluent strength.", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because eluent strength is a measure of the ability of a solvent to dissolve and transport a sample, and it is inversely proportional to the retention time of the sample.
