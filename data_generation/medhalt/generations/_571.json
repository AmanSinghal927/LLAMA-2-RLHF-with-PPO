Over time, the amount of plaque can decrease as the microorganisms break down the existing plaque and prevent new plaque from forming.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because as time passes, the plaque microflora undergoes a shift from gram-negative to gram-positive bacteria, which leads to an increase in the proportion of the latter.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Plaque microflora undergoes changes with time. Initially, it is composed of gram positive bacteria, but as time progresses, the plaque microflora becomes predominantly spirochetal. This is because spirochetes are more resistant to antimicrobial agents and can survive in the presence of antibiotics, whereas gram positive bacteria are more susceptible to antibiotics. Therefore, as the plaque matures, the spirochetes become more dominant.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Over time, the plaque microflora undergoes changes in its composition and becomes more gram negative as the growth of gram-positive bacteria is inhibited by the accumulation of organic matter and the presence of antibacterial substances.\n\n"}, {"question": "A physician is involved in a research collaboration with a pharmaceutical company.
