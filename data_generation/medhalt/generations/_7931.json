Resistance to NRTIs is often associated with mutations in the rev gene, which codes for the rev transcription factor.

Mutations in the rev gene can lead to decreased susceptibility to NRTIs, resulting in resistance to these drugs.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The answer is D)env because the mutations in the env gene are responsible for the resistance to emtricitabine and tenofovir. The env gene encodes the envelope protein of HIV, which is the primary target of these drugs.
