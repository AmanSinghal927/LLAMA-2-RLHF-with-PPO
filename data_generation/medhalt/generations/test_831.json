The presence of ascites, hepatomegaly, and scleral icterus also support this diagnosis. The paracentesis fluid analysis shows a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, which is consistent with a bacterial infection in the setting of cirrhosis.

The paracentesis fluid analysis shows a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, which is indicative of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The addition of cefotaxime and albumin is appropriate for the management of SBP, but the patient's condition is likely to worsen without further intervention. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to treat SBP by reducing the portal pressure and improving the flow of blood through the liver.
