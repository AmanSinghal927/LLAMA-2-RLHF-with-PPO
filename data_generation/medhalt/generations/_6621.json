It is characterized by a gradual decrease in the curvature of the tooth from the incisal edge to the cingulum. This curve is named after Dr. John Wilson, who first described it in the early 20th century. The Wilson curve is not typically seen in molars, premolars, or other teeth.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The Wilson curve is a representation of the shape of the occlusal surface of the molars. It is a curved line that represents the orientation of the occlusal surface of the molars in the sagittal plane. The molars have a more complex occlusal surface compared to the premolars and anteriors, which makes them more susceptible to occlusal trauma. Therefore, the Wilson curve is more pronounced in the molars.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the Wilson curve is a shape that is commonly seen in the premolar teeth, and is characterized by a sharp curvature of the tooth surface.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: The Wilson curve is a graphical representation of the shape of the tooth, and it can be observed in all the teeth you have mentioned. The curve is characterized by a gradual increase in height from the incisal edge to the cingulum, followed by a decrease in height towards the occlusal surface. This shape is present in all teeth, but the degree of curvature may vary.\n\n"}, {"question": "Absorption elution technique is used for -", "correct_answer": "Seminal stain examination", "options": ["A)None of the above", "B)Seminal stain examination", "C)Species detection", "D)Blood group detection"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Absorption elution technique is used for -A)None of the above B)Seminal stain examination C)Species detection D)Blood group detection\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the absorption elution technique is not used for any of the above applications.
