The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body. The prostate gland does not have the function of storing sperm, as sperm are produced in the testes.

The prostate gland produces a fluid that makes up a portion of semen, and it also helps to keep the urethra moist. However, the prostate gland does not store sperm, and it does not have a direct role in the storage of sperm. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because the prostate gland does not have a direct hormonal influence. Option B is incorrect because the urethra is not the only structure that passes through the prostate gland. Instead, the urethra passes through the prostate gland, and the prostate gland surrounds the urethra. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Option D is correct because the prostate gland is made up of acini (alveoli), which are small sacs that contain prostatic concretions. These concretions are made up of prostate tissue and other substances, and they can be found in the prostate gland.
