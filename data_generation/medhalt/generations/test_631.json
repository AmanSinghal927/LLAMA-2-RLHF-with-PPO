It has been associated with a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect called membranous nephropathy, which is a type of kidney disease. This side effect is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and damage to the kidneys. The symptoms of membranous nephropathy can include proteinuria, hematuria, and decreased kidney function.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Montelukast is an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Adrenaline and isoprenaline both bind to the beta-2 receptor, but adrenaline has a higher affinity and isoprenaline has a lower affinity. Histamine and adrenaline both bind to the H1 receptor, but histamine has a higher affinity. Propranolol is a beta-blocker and blocks the action of adrenaline at the beta-1 receptor. Therefore, all of the options demonstrate receptor level antagonism.", "output4": "\n<bot>: Isoprenaline and propranolol both bind to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, but they have different effects on the receptor. Isoprenaline is an agonist, which means it activates the receptor and causes it to increase the activity of the cell. Propranolol, on the other hand, is an antagonist, which means it binds to the receptor but does not activate it. Instead, it blocks the action of other agonists, such as isoprenaline, by inhibiting the activity of the receptor. Therefore, isoprenaline and propranolol demonstrate receptor level antagonism.\n\n"}, {"question": "About Meckel's diverticulum (Meckel diverticulum), the following statements is wrong?", "correct_answer": "Usually located away from the ileocecal valve (ileocecal valve) end of the ileum 50 to 75 cm", "options": ["A)The most common clinical manifestations of painless bleeding, followed by bowel obstruction", "B)May contain ectopic tissue (ectopic tissue), stomach tissue common than pancreatic tissue", "C)Younger children older than children, more likely diverticulitis (diverticulitis)", "D)Usually located away from the ileocecal valve (ileocecal valve) end of the ileum 50 to 75 cm"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:About Meckel's diverticulum (Meckel diverticulum), the following statements is wrong?A)The most common clinical manifestations of painless bleeding, followed by bowel obstruction B)May contain ectopic tissue (ectopic tissue), stomach tissue common than pancreatic tissue C)Younger children older than children, more likely diverticulitis (diverticulitis) D)Usually located away from the ileocecal valve (ileocecal valve) end of the ileum 50 to 75 cm\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot> A: Because Meckel's diverticulum is more likely to cause painless bleeding than bowel obstruction.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because Meckel's diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which normally degenerates during fetal development.
