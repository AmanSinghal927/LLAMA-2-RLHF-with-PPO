It is a layer of dentin that forms on the surface of the tooth, and it helps to protect the tooth from further damage and infection. By allowing secondary dentin formation to occur before completing the debridement, the dentist can ensure that the tooth is protected from further damage and that the healing process is not disrupted.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because incomplete debridement is done to seal the cavity and create aseptic field to prevent bacterial contamination and promote healing.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because incomplete debridement can cause microleakage, which can lead to bacterial contamination and further decay.
