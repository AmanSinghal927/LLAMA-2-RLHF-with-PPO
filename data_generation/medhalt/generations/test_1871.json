When the lateral pterygoid muscle contracts bilaterally, it causes the condyle to move laterally, resulting in the lateral movement of the jaw.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The epsilateral lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for lateral movement of the condyle because it is the only muscle that attaches to the lateral surface of the condyle.

These two muscles work together to control the movement of the condyle. When the lateral pterygoid muscle contracts, it pulls the condyle laterally, and when the medial pterygoid muscle contracts, it pulls the condyle medially. Therefore, the lateral and medial pterygoid muscles must contract simultaneously to produce lateral movement of the condyle.\n\n"}, {"question": "In atomic absorption spectroscopy, electrothermal atomization has some advantages over flame atomization, such as:", "correct_answer": "Greater reproducibility", "options": ["A)High sensitivity", "B)Low background signal.", "C)Greater reproducibility", "D)High analytical interval."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:In atomic absorption spectroscopy, electrothermal atomization has some advantages over flame atomization, such as:A)High sensitivity B)Low background signal.
