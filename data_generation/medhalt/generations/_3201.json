This indicates:A)Proximal stripping B)No extraction required C)No extraction required if treated at an early age D)Extraction of posterior teeth\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because proximal stripping is the most effective way to address a discrepancy of more than 10 mm in the dentition. It involves removing a small amount of enamel from the teeth to bring them into proper alignment. This can be done at an early age, before the teeth have fully erupted, to prevent the need for extraction.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the discrepancy is within the normal range of 6-10 mm.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the discrepancy can be corrected with early orthodontic treatment, which will guide the eruption of the teeth and prevent the need for extraction.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the discrepancy of more than 10 mm indicates that the teeth are not in the correct position and will not be able to function properly.
