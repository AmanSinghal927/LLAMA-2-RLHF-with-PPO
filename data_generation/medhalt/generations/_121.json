[{"question": "Which of the following substituents behaves as a guide towards the meta position when said atom or group is replacing one of the benzene hydrogens and a nitration reaction proceeding through an electrophilic substitution mechanism is carried out on said substituted benzene? aromatic ?:", "correct_answer": "An alkyl group.", "options": ["A)An amino group.", "B)An alkyl group.", "C)A chlorine atom.", "D)A nitro group."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following substituents behaves as a guide towards the meta position when said atom or group is replacing one of the benzene hydrogens and a nitration reaction proceeding through an electrophilic substitution mechanism is carried out on said substituted benzene? aromatic ?:A)An amino group. B)An alkyl group. C)A chlorine atom. D)A nitro group.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: When an amino group is substituted for one of the benzene hydrogens, it behaves as a guide towards the meta position because it is a strong electron-donating group. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the amino group is donated to the benzene ring, which increases the electron density in the meta position. As a result, the electrophilic substitution reaction proceeds more easily in the meta position, leading to the formation of the desired meta-substituted product.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: When an alkyl group is substituted for one of the benzene hydrogens, it orients the molecule so that the positive charge of the electrophile (the nitrating agent) is directed towards the meta position. This is because the alkyl group is a bulky group and tends to push the benzene ring away from the nitrating agent, resulting in a greater concentration of the electrophile at the meta position.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: When a chlorine atom is substituted for one of the hydrogen atoms on benzene, it acts as a guide towards the meta position because it is a highly electronegative atom that exerts a strong electron withdrawing effect on the benzene ring. This causes the benzene ring to become more polarized, which in turn increases the reactivity of the meta position. As a result, the nitration reaction is more likely to occur at the meta position.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When a nitro group is present in the benzene ring, it increases the electronegativity of the ring and makes the ring more electron-deficient. This makes the ring more susceptible to electrophilic substitution, and the nitro group acts as a guide towards the meta position.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following cause an increase in ACh release from the presynaptic neuron?", "correct_answer": "Blocking chloride channel on presynaptic", "options": ["A)Blocking calcium channels on presynaptic", "B)Blocking K channels", "C)Blocking chloride channel on presynaptic", "D)Blocking Na channel"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following cause an increase in ACh release from the presynaptic neuron?A)Blocking calcium channels on presynaptic B)Blocking K channels C)Blocking chloride channel on presynaptic D)Blocking Na channel\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because blocking calcium channels on the presynaptic neuron will increase the amount of calcium ions available for the release of ACh from the vesicles.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because K channels are responsible for the repolarization of the presynaptic neuron after an action potential. When K channels are blocked, the presynaptic neuron remains in an excitatory state for a longer period of time, leading to an increase in ACh release.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because chloride channels are responsible for the regulation of the resting membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron, and when they are blocked, the membrane potential becomes more positive, leading to an increase in the release of ACh.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When Na channels are blocked, the membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron becomes more negative, which increases the likelihood of ACh release.\n\n"}, {"question": "What type of hormone is calcitonin based on its chemical nature ?:", "correct_answer": "Catecholamine", "options": ["A)Steroid.", "B)Catecholamine", "C)Peptide.", "D)Colecalciferol."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:What type of hormone is calcitonin based on its chemical nature ?:A)Steroid.
