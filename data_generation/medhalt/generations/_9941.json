The refractive error varies depending on the orientation of the visual axis, resulting in the perception of different shapes by each eye.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Astigmatism is caused by an unequal refraction of light rays in the cornea and lens, resulting in blurred vision. The refraction of light rays varies along different meridians, causing a difference in the focus of the image on the retina.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because in astigmatism, the eye has a longer AP length than the MD length, which causes the light to be refracted more in one meridian than the other, resulting in blurred vision.\n<human>"}, {"question": "Which of the following bacterial genetic elements necessarily encodes a transposase ?:", "correct_answer": "Plasmid", "options": ["A)Replicon", "B)Plasmid", "C)Integr\u00f3n", "D)Insertion sequence"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following bacterial genetic elements necessarily encodes a transposase ?:A)Replicon B)Plasmid C)Integr\u00f3n D)Insertion sequence\n\nA:", "output1": "\n\n", "output2": "\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: An integr\u00f3n is a genetic element that encodes a transposase, which is necessary for its movement between different locations in the genome.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because insertion sequences are bacterial genetic elements that encode transposases.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is the management for neglected case of CTEV in a patient > 10 years of age?", "correct_answer": "Ankle ahrodesis", "options": ["A)Ankle ahrodesis", "B)Jess fixation", "C)Ponseti casting", "D)Triple ahrodesis"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is the management for neglected case of CTEV in a patient > 10 years of age?A)Ankle ahrodesis B)Jess fixation C)Ponseti casting D)Triple ahrodesis\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because in patients over 10 years of age, the management for neglected case of CTEV is usually ankle arthrodesis, as the deformity is more rigid and fixed.
