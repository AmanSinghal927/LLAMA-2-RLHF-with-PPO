The PDL is a fibrous tissue that attaches the tooth to the surrounding bone, and when it becomes inflamed, it can cause the tooth to become loose and the bone to become exposed. This can lead to the development of osteomyelitis.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because subperiosteal bone deposition is the earliest radiographic sign of osteomyelitis, and it indicates the presence of inflammation and new bone formation in the periosteum.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because loss of vascularity is a sign of infarction, which is the first radiographic sign of osteomyelitis.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Blurring of trabeculae is the first radiographic sign of osteomyelitis because it is caused by the inflammatory response to the infection, which leads to a loss of definition of the trabeculae.\n\n"}, {"question": "Most commonly used technique for recording centric relation is :", "correct_answer": "Intra-oral tracer technique.", "options": ["A)Needles- house technique.", "B)Paterson technique.", "C)Intra-oral tracer technique.", "D)Extra-oral tracer technique."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Most commonly used technique for recording centric relation is :A)Needles- house technique.
