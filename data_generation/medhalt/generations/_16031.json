This is a type of anemia that occurs in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and is characterized by decreased production of \u03b2-globin chains, leading to hypochromic, hypersegmented red blood cells.

Anemia of chronic disease is a condition in which the body produces fewer red blood cells in response to chronic inflammation, such as that caused by rheumatoid arthritis. The body's response to inflammation includes the production of cytokines, which can cause a decrease in the production of nitrogenous bases, such as purines and pyrimidines, which are necessary for the synthesis of heme.
