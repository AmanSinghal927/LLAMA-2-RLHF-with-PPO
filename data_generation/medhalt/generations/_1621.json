The pathophysiology of this patient's presentation is therefore most likely due to an excessive irreversible inactivation of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme, which is a key enzyme involved in the coagulation cascade. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) to prostacyclin, which is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and a promoter of vasodilation.

Allopurinol is a medication that is used to treat conditions such as gout and hyperuricemia by inhibiting the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. HGPRT is responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine and guanine to inosine and xanthine, respectively. The inhibition of HGPRT by allopurinol leads to an accumulation of these purine bases, which can cause a range of symptoms, including hypersensitivity to purines, facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements.
