This modification is important for the stability and translation of the mRNA.\n\n", "output3": "\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because mature cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized in the nucleus from DNA and then transported to the cytoplasm, where it is translated into protein. Since mRNA is synthesized from DNA, it contains the sugar deoxyribose, rather than thiamine or uracil. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Sugar is Deoxy Ribose.\n\n"}, {"question": "Respiratory bronchioles are formed from ?", "correct_answer": "Lobar bronchioles", "options": ["A)Principal bronchus", "B)Terminal bronchioles", "C)Lobar bronchioles", "D)Teiary Bronchus"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Respiratory bronchioles are formed from ?A)Principal bronchus B)Terminal bronchioles C)Lobar bronchioles D)Teiary Bronchus\n\nA:", "output1": "\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the terminal bronchioles are the smallest branches of the respiratory bronchioles, and they are responsible for the exchange of gases between the blood and the air in the lungs.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the terminal bronchioles are the smallest branches of the respiratory bronchioles, and they are the site of gas exchange in the lungs.
