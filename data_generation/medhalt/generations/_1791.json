When it is placed in the mouth, it can resemble caries in radiographs because it has a similar radiographic density to the tooth structure. This can make it difficult to distinguish between the two. However, there are some differences in the radiographic appearance of caries and zinc oxide eugenol. Caries typically has a more well-defined boundary and a more irregular surface, while zinc oxide eugenol is more smooth and even.
