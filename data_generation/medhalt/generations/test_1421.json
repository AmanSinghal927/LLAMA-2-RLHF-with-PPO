It is a self-setting, non-condensing material that does not require a separate catalyst. It has a high accuracy and detail, and is less prone to distortion and shrinkage. Additionally, it is a hydrophilic material that can be easily cleaned and disinfected, which is important in patients with a history of radiation therapy.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because, in this case, the patient has a radiation-induced fibrosis, which can make it difficult to obtain a good impression with other materials. Irreversible hydrocolloids can help to capture the details of the tissue surface, even in the presence of fibrosis. Additionally, they can be easily removed from the patient's mouth without causing any harm.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because polysulfide impression material is the most appropriate for edentulous patients, as it is less likely to distort or tear during the impression process, and it can be easily removed from the oral cavity. Additionally, polysulfide impression material is less toxic and more biocompatible than other materials, which is important for patients with compromised health status.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Polyether impression material is the best choice for edentulous patients who have undergone radiation therapy, as it is more resistant to radiation degradation than other impression materials.\n\n"}, {"question": "Respiratery quotient is the Ratio of -", "correct_answer": "02 consumed to Co, released", "options": ["A)02 released to CO2 consumed", "B)CO2 consumed to 02 released", "C)02 consumed to Co, released", "D)Co, released to 02 consumed"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Respiratery quotient is the Ratio of -A)02 released to CO2 consumed B)CO2 consumed to 02 released C)02 consumed to Co, released D)Co, released to 02 consumed\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measure of the amount of CO2 produced by the body per unit of O2 consumed.
