This can be particularly dangerous in patients who are sitting in a wheelchair with a tiltable backrest, as the sudden drop in blood pressure can cause the patient to fall forward or backward, leading to injury or further complications. Therefore, patients with postural hypotension should be advised to avoid using wheelchairs with tiltable backrests.\n\n"}, {"question": "On which day LH & FSH should be measured ?", "correct_answer": "14th day", "options": ["A)1-3rd day", "B)14th day", "C)7th day", "D)10th day"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:On which day LH & FSH should be measured ?A)1-3rd day B)14th day C)7th day D)10th day\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the LH surge typically occurs on the 1-3rd day of the menstrual cycle, and FSH levels are usually highest on the 7th day.

Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy is a surgical procedure that involves release of the capsular ligaments to allow for correction of the deformity. The increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones seen on X-ray suggests that the deformity is caused by a rigidity in the hindfoot.

Arthrodesis of the forefoot, which is the fusion of the joints in the forefoot, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. This will provide stability to the foot and prevent further deformity.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to treat the clubfoot with a foot abduction brace, which will help to correct the deformity and prevent any further complications. Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy and arthrodesis of the forefoot are more invasive procedures that may be considered as a last resort if other treatments fail.
