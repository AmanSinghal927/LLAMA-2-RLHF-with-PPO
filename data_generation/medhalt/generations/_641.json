The study only included 20 patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and 19 patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, which is a very small sample size. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to the larger population.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the difference observed between the two strata is likely due to random error. The sample size of each stratum is not large enough to detect a significant association between cART adherence and DLBCL risk, especially for the stratum with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3. Therefore, the difference observed between the two strata is likely due to chance rather than a real effect.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. In other words, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is different in the two strata. Specifically, cART adherence is a significant predictor of DLBCL risk among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, but not among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3. This difference in the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is an example of effect modification.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the study found a significant relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, but not among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3. This suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk may be modified by CD4+ cell counts at the time of diagnosis. Stratified sampling is a method of analyzing data that takes into account the distribution of the data in different subgroups or strata. In this case, the study stratified by CD4+ cell counts, which allowed them to identify the significant relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk in the subgroup of patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is a typical symptom of carotid cavernous \ue947 tube (Carotid-cavernous fistula) is?", "correct_answer": "Lens opacity", "options": ["A)Conjunctiva varices", "B)Lens opacity", "C)Enophthalmos", "D)Reduce intraocular pressure"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is a typical symptom of carotid cavernous \ue947 tube (Carotid-cavernous fistula) is?A)Conjunctiva varices B)Lens opacity C)Enophthalmos D)Reduce intraocular pressure\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot> A: Because the conjunctiva is the tissue that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids.
