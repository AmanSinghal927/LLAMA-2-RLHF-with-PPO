These abnormalities can lead to a combination of male and female physical characteristics, such as ambiguous genitalia, and are the most common cause of male pseudohermaphrodism.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause of male pseudohermaphrodism because it is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the production of cortisol and aldosterone. Without this enzyme, the adrenal glands produce too much estrogen and too little androgen, leading to the development of female-like characteristics in males.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Male pseudohermaphrodism is caused by cytogenetic abnormalities, which are changes in the number or arrangement of the chromosomes. These changes can result in the development of both ovarian and testicular tissue in the same individual, leading to the characteristic mixture of male and female physical characteristics.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because in male pseudohermaphrodism, the most common cause is adrenocortical tumor.\n\n"}, {"question": "Bilateral breast carcinoma", "correct_answer": "Infiltractive ductal", "options": ["A)Invasive lobular", "B)Ductal ca in situ", "C)None", "D)Infiltractive ductal"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Bilateral breast carcinomaA)Invasive lobular B)Ductal ca in situ C)None D)Infiltractive ductal\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the question asks about bilateral breast carcinoma, and invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that affects the lobules of the breast, and can be bilateral.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the patient has a history of bilateral breast carcinoma, and the presence of DCIS in one breast increases the risk of developing invasive cancer in the other breast.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the breast tissue is not present in the image.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Bilateral breast carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that affects both breasts.

This polarity allows them to form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules, which are relatively strong and stable. These bonds are responsible for the cohesion and surface tension of water.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Water molecules are held together by Van der Waals forces, which are weak intermolecular forces that arise from the temporary dipoles that form between molecules. These dipoles are caused by the movement of electrons in the molecules, and they are responsible for the cohesion and surface tension of water.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is the nodal centre for disaster management", "correct_answer": "CHC", "options": ["A)None", "B)Control room", "C)PHC", "D)CHC"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is the nodal centre for disaster managementA)None B)Control room C)PHC D)CHC\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because there is no nodal centre for disaster management.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the control room is the central location where all the information and resources are coordinated and managed during a disaster situation.
