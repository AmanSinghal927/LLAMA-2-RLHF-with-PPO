Memantine has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce agitation in patients with delirium. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic pyelonephritis may be contributing factors to her cognitive impairment, and memantine may help to mitigate these effects.\n<human>"}, {"question": "In a survey of sleep apnea scores among 10 people, the highest sample of 58 was entered by mistake as 85.
