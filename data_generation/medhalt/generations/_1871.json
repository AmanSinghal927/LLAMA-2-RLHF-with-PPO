However, new lesions may appear as existing ones are resolving, leading to a cycle of recurrent hives.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because mast cells are responsible for the production of histamine, which causes the swelling and itching associated with hives. When the skin is mechanically stimulated, the mast cells release histamine, leading to the formation of hives.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because sunlight and extreme temperatures can cause the release of histamine from mast cells, leading to the formation of hives.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because the other options are not correct statements about hives.
