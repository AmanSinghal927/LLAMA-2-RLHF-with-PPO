It is not found in other types of muscles, such as flexor muscles, and is therefore exclusive to antigravity extensor muscles.\n\n", "output2": "\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Muscle spindles are specialized sensory receptors found in skeletal muscles that detect changes in muscle length. They are excited by both stretch and contraction of the muscles in which they are located, which is why option B is incorrect. The muscle spindle is responsible for the stretch reflex, which is a reflexive response to stretching of the muscle. Therefore, option A is incorrect, as muscle spindles do not occur only in antigravity extensor muscles.\n\n", "output4": "\n\n"}, {"question": "Sorbitol is added in toothpastes as?", "correct_answer": "Detergent", "options": ["A)Detergent", "B)Humectants", "C)Abrasive", "D)Sweetners"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Sorbitol is added in toothpastes as?A)Detergent B)Humectants C)Abrasive D)Sweetners\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Sorbitol is added to toothpastes as a detergent because it helps to remove plaque and tartar from teeth.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Sorbitol is a humectant that helps to keep the toothpaste moist and prevent it from drying out.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Sorbitol is a sugar substitute that is used as an abrasive in toothpastes to help remove plaque and stains from the teeth.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Sorbitol is a sugar substitute that is used as a sweetener in toothpastes.
