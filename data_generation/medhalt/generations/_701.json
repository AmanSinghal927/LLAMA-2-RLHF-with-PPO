Piaget, on the other hand, described the preoperational stage as occurring between the ages of 2 and 7, during which children begin to use symbols and language to represent the world around them, but they do not yet have the ability to think logically and abstractly. The preoperational stage is characterized by egocentrism and the inability to take the perspective of others.
