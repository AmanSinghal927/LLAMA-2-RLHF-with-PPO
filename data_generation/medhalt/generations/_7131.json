The patient's previous episodes of similar symptoms also suggest that the mutation is a recurrent one. A nonsense mutation (A) would result in the production of a premature stop codon, which would lead to the production of a truncated protein that is unlikely to cause the severe symptoms seen in this patient. A chromosomal deletion (C) would result in the loss of a segment of DNA, which would also lead to the loss of function of a protein.
