This method is used to introduce the sample into the separation capillary in a controlled manner, allowing for precise control over the amount of sample introduced and the injection timing.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: In hydrodynamic injection, a high potential difference is applied between the ends of the capillary, causing an electric field to be generated. This electric field causes the sample to be injected into the capillary by hydrodynamic injection.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: In hydrodynamic injection, a small potential difference is applied between the ends of the capillary, which creates a flow of fluid through the capillary. This flow helps to inject the sample into the capillary.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When the temperature of the capillary is increased, the solvent molecules in the sample have more kinetic energy, which allows them to penetrate the capillary wall more easily.
