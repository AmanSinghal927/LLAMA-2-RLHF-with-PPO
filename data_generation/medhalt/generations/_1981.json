This is because thromboplastin is a component of the intrinsic pathway and calcium ions are required for the activation of factor X, which is a key enzyme in the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is not activated because there are no tissue factor and factor VIIa present in the plasma. Therefore, the correct answer is A)Intrinsic.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the addition of calcium and thromboplastin to platelet poor plasma activates the extrinsic coagulation pathway, which leads to the formation of thrombin.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: When calcium and thromboplastin are added to platelet poor plasma, they activate the fibrinolytic pathway, which leads to the breakdown of the fibrin clot.
