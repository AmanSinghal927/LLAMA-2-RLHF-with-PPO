B)Same as compared to a normal tooth. C)More as compared to a normal tooth. D)None.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The rate of resorption in an endodontically treated tooth is less as compared to a normal tooth because the root canal treatment removes the pulp tissue, which is the primary source of resorption.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The resorption rate in an endodontically treated tooth is the same as in a normal tooth because the tooth structure is still intact, and the pulp chamber is sealed with a filling material.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: The resorption process is a natural process in which the tooth's supporting tissues are broken down and resorbed by the body. In an endodontically treated tooth, the pulp chamber is removed and the tooth is left without the protective barrier of the pulp. As a result, the tooth becomes more susceptible to resorption.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Resorption is a process of loss of tooth structure, and endodontic treatment is a procedure to save the tooth. Therefore, there is no resorption in an endodontically treated tooth.\n\n"}, {"question": "The best finish line for anterior metal ceramic crown is", "correct_answer": "Heavy chamfer", "options": ["A)Shoulder", "B)Heavy chamfer", "C)Chamfer with bevel", "D)Shoulder with bevel"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:The best finish line for anterior metal ceramic crown isA)Shoulder B)Heavy chamfer C)Chamfer with bevel D)Shoulder with bevel\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the shoulder finish provides the most retention and resistance to dislodgment, especially when the crown is subjected to the forces of chewing and biting.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: A heavy chamfer provides a strong, smooth, and esthetically pleasing finish line for anterior metal ceramic crowns.

Applying too much force can cause damage to the teeth and surrounding structures.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The answer is based on the fact that the masticatory load that natural teeth can bear is limited by the forces acting on the teeth during chewing, and the strength of the teeth and their supporting tissues. The maximum masticatory load that natural teeth can bear is typically around 5 kg.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the natural teeth can bear a masticatory load of up to 40kg, as per the generally accepted standards of dental anatomy and physiology.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Natural teeth are designed to bear a certain amount of masticatory load, which is the force exerted by the jaw muscles during chewing. The amount of load that natural teeth can bear varies from person to person, but on average, healthy adult teeth can bear a masticatory load of around 10 kg. This is because the teeth are designed to be strong and durable, and they are also supported by the jaw bone and other tissues. However, if the masticatory load exceeds the capacity of the teeth, it can lead to dental problems such as tooth wear, cracks, and even tooth loss.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following clinical features of demyelinating myelopathy least likely suggests a progression to multiple sclerosis?", "correct_answer": "Poor prognosis", "options": ["A)Bilateral visual loss", "B)Poor prognosis", "C)Absence of oligoclonal bands", "D)Complete cord transection"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following clinical features of demyelinating myelopathy least likely suggests a progression to multiple sclerosis?A)Bilateral visual loss B)Poor prognosis C)Absence of oligoclonal bands D)Complete cord transection\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Bilateral visual loss is a common feature of optic neuritis, which is a relatively benign condition that is often associated with demyelinating myelopathy.
