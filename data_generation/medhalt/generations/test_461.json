The patient's symptoms of pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin are consistent with seafood poisoning. Additionally, the patient's history of narrow-angle glaucoma and the fact that his symptoms began suddenly after eating seafood suggest that seafood poisoning is the most likely cause of his symptoms.

It is appropriate for the patient's symptoms of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin. The patient's history of similar symptoms in the past and the sudden onset of symptoms suggest an allergic reaction, which is consistent with the use of Calamine lotion.
