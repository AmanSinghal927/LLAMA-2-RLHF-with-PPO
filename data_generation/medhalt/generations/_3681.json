It works by binding to specific receptors on the surface of pancreatic cells, which activates an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the release of digestive enzymes. One of the key signaling molecules involved in this process is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which is generated from the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). IP3 then binds to and activates a protein called diacylglycerol (DAG), which in turn activates protein kinase C (PKC). This activation of PKC leads to the phosphorylation and activation of various downstream signaling proteins, including adenylyl cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that stimulates the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas. It does this by binding to CCK receptors on the surface of pancreatic cells, which leads to the opening of ion channels and an influx of calcium ions into the cells. The increased calcium levels then trigger the release of the digestive enzymes.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that stimulates the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gallbladder, respectively. It does this by activating adenylyl cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the pancreatic acinar cells. The increase in cAMP triggers the exocytosis of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreatic acinar cells and the gallbladder, respectively.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that regulates gallbladder contraction and pancreatic secretion. It binds to its receptor on the surface of pancreatic cells, which activates the transcription factor NF-\u03baB.
