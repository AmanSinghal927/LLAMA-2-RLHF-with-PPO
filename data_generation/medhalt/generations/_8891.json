In the case of cartilaginous injuries, the lack of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration can lead to minimal signs of healing. Transplanting perichondrium tissue into the injured area could provide the necessary progenitor cells for matrix regeneration and promote healing.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Proteoglycans are the main component of the cartilage matrix and play a crucial role in the regeneration of cartilage. The absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration in the group with cartilaginous injury suggests that the lack of proteoglycans is hindering the healing process. Therefore, transplanting proteoglycans would most likely promote healing in this group.", "output3": "\n<bot>: Mature chondrocytes are the cells responsible for producing and maintaining the cartilage matrix in the knee joint.
