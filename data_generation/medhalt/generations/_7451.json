The Superior mesenteric artery is the most likely cause of this obstruction, as it is the main artery that supplies blood to the small intestine. The other options, such as the inferior vena cava, common bile duct, and portal vein, are not likely to cause this type of obstruction.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the patient is experiencing nausea and bilious vomiting, which are both symptoms of obstruction of the inferior vena cava. Additionally, the patient's weight loss and abdominal distention are also consistent with this diagnosis. The inferior vena cava is responsible for returning blood from the lower half of the body to the heart, and obstruction of this vessel can cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The correct answer is C)Common bile duct because the patient has a history of bariatric surgery, which can cause alterations in the anatomy of the biliary system. The common bile duct is a common site for obstruction after bariatric surgery. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of nausea and bilious vomiting, along with the sloshing sound on auscultation of the abdomen, are consistent with a biliary obstruction. The other options, A, B, and D, are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The patient's symptoms of nausea and bilious vomiting, along with the sloshing sound on auscultation of the abdomen, are consistent with a portal vein obstruction. The fact that there is no passage of contrast past the third segment of the duodenum on an upper gastrointestinal series also supports this diagnosis. The portal vein is the most likely structure to be causing the obstruction in this patient.\n\n"}, {"question": "Blood supplying medial part of brain is mainly", "correct_answer": "Posterior cerebral artery", "options": ["A)Posterior cerebral artery", "B)Vertebral artery", "C)Anterior cerebral artery", "D)Middle cerebral artery"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Blood supplying medial part of brain is mainlyA)Posterior cerebral artery B)Vertebral artery C)Anterior cerebral artery D)Middle cerebral artery\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The posterior cerebral artery supplies the medial part of the brain, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the vertebral artery supplies the medial part of the brain, including the cerebral hemispheres, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The anterior cerebral artery is the main blood supply to the medial part of the brain, including the hemispheres, the internal capsule, and the lenticular nucleus.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The middle cerebral artery is the main blood vessel that supplies the medial part of the brain, including the hemispheres, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus.\n\n"}, {"question": "Infant of 3 months properly vaccinated for his age, who after two weeks of rhinorrhea, sneezing and cough, enters by intensifying coughing accesses, with cyanosis at the end of them, ending with deep inspiration or inspiratory rooster, requiring stimulation, aspiration of secretions and oxygen to recover from them.
