The abdominal ultrasound is the most appropriate diagnostic tool to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Amelia is a congenital abnormality that is associated with poor diabetic control during pregnancy. It is caused by a failure of the neural tube to close properly, resulting in a lack of development of the brain and spinal cord. The patient's history of poor diabetic control before becoming pregnant increases the likelihood of this abnormality.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The patient's history of poor diabetic control before pregnancy and the fundal height of 20 cm (7.9 in) at 18 weeks gestation suggest a possible association with congenital heart defects. Ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital heart defect and is more likely to occur in cases of poor diabetic control. Sacral agenesis, Amelia, and Spina bifida are less likely to be associated with poor diabetic control.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Spina bifida is a common congenital abnormality in infants of diabetic mothers, and it is often associated with poor maternal glycemic control during pregnancy.
