The fact that she has a history of a recent viral infection suggests that the ITP is likely to be a post-infectious variant. In this case, the next best step is to observe the patient closely and monitor her platelet count. If the platelet count falls below 10,000/mcL or if there are signs of bleeding, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be considered.
