It is caused by a genetic mutation that leads to the overproduction of growth hormone, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including bone pain, deformity, and short stature. Albright's syndrome, on the other hand, is a condition that is caused by a genetic mutation that affects the production of thyroid hormones, and it does not involve bone development. Paget's disease is a bone disorder that is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and it does not have a primary endocrine cause. Acromegaly is a condition that is caused by an excess of growth hormone, but it does not involve bone development. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Fibrous dysplasia.", "output4": "\n<bot>: Albright's syndrome is caused by a mutation in the Gs alpha subunit gene, which leads to an excess of active Gs protein and an overproduction of insulin and growth hormone.

USG is the best imaging modality to evaluate the shoulder region and detect any fluid or inflammation in the joint.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Intraaicular lignocaine injection is the most appropriate next step in management of shoulder pain after laparoscopic surgery because it can help to reduce the pain and inflammation in the shoulder region. Additionally, it is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia, which reduces the risk of complications compared to diagnostic arthroscopy or USG. Furthermore, oral paracetamol may not be sufficient to manage the pain, and it is not a definitive diagnosis.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because shoulder pain after laparoscopic surgery is usually due to inflammation and paracetamol is an anti-inflammatory medication.\n\n"}, {"question": "Most common infection post solid organ transplantation", "correct_answer": "HSV", "options": ["A)CMV", "B)HSV", "C)EBV", "D)HPV"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Most common infection post solid organ transplantationA)CMV B)HSV C)EBV D)HPV\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: CMV (cytomegalovirus) is the most common infection post solid organ transplantation because it is a common virus that can cause infection in people with weakened immune systems, and solid organ transplant recipients are at high risk for CMV infection due to their immunosuppressive medications.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Human herpesvirus (HHV) is the most common infection after solid organ transplantation.
