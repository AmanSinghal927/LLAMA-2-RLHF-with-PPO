It is involved in the modulation of pain perception, and it has been shown to be elevated in individuals with chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the transmission of pain signals in the central nervous system. It is released by neurons in the spinal cord and brain, and it acts on receptors on the surface of neurons to transmit pain signals.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the transmission of pain signals. It is released in response to tissue damage or inflammation and can contribute to the development of chronic pain.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Substance P is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the transmission of pain signals from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. It is released by sensory neurons in response to tissue damage or inflammation, and it activates the spinal cord's pain pathways.
