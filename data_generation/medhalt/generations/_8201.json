Iron deficiency anemia is caused by a lack of iron in the body, which leads to a decrease in the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. The body compensates for the lack of iron by increasing the production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells. However, this compensation mechanism can only go so far, and eventually, the body's tissues will become hypoxic, leading to the symptoms the patient is experiencing.
