Tension pneumothorax is caused by air entering the pleural space and pushing the lung away from the chest wall, which can cause a decrease in lung volume and a decrease in the right side of the chest wall.

Cardiac tamponade, on the other hand, is characterized by a gradual onset of mild to moderate chest pain, dyspnea, and a low-pitched breath sound (sub-cardiac rumble).
