Thiopentone is known to lower the seizure threshold and can cause seizures in susceptible individuals, including epileptic patients. Midazolam, ketamine, and propofol are safer options for these patients. Thank you for your question!", "output4": "\n<bot>: Propofol is contraindicated in epileptic patients because it has been associated with a high risk of seizures and status epilepticus. This is due to the fact that propofol can cause a dose-dependent decrease in the seizure threshold, which can trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in epileptic patients.\n\n"}, {"question": "Overload of denture base is caused by:", "correct_answer": "Large teeth", "options": ["A)Small teeth", "B)Large teeth", "C)Small bases", "D)Too large bases"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Overload of denture base is caused by:A)Small teeth B)Large teeth C)Small bases D)Too large bases\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the denture base is designed to fit over the teeth, and if the teeth are too small, the denture base will be too large and may overload the denture, causing discomfort and potentially leading to denture failure.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the denture base is designed to fit over the teeth, and if the teeth are too large, the base will be overloaded and may not fit properly.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because a small base can lead to overload on the denture base, causing it to become unstable and potentially leading to denture failure.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the base of the denture is too large, it can cause overload on the denture, leading to discomfort and difficulty in chewing.\n\n"}, {"question": "Stroke volume increases in pregnancy by", "correct_answer": "40%", "options": ["A)20%", "B)25%", "C)45%", "D)40%"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Stroke volume increases in pregnancy byA)20% B)25% C)45% D)40%\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: During pregnancy, the cardiac output increases to meet the increased metabolic demands of the growing fetus.
