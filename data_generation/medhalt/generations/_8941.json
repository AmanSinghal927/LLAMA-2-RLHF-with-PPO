This is a passive process, as there is no energy input required to drive the secretion.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because in the distal tubule, ammonia is secreted through the action of the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) and the basolateral Na+/H+ antiporter (NHX1). This process is driven by the concentration gradient of Na+ and H+ ions across the brush border membrane, and the energy required for this process is provided by the electrochemical gradient of Na+ and H+ ions. Therefore, the mechanism of secretion of ammonia in the distal tubule is primary active transport.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Symport is a process of cotransport of two or more substances across a membrane, which is the mechanism of secretion of ammonia in distal tubule.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because in the distal tubule, the ammonia is secreted through the action of the antiporter, which is a protein that can transport two or more substances in opposite directions across the membrane. The antiporter in this case is the Rh protein, which is responsible for the secretion of ammonia from the renal tubular cells into the tubular fluid.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 21-year-old old college student is brought to the emergency department by his roommates because he has been \"acting strangely.\" Over the last 7 months, he has claimed to hear voices telling him that he must prepare for the end of the world.
