When the BP180 gene is mutated, the protein is not produced correctly, leading to the formation of large, fluid-filled blisters on the skin. Because the mutation is located on an autosome (a non-sex chromosome), it can be inherited by both males and females, and the trait is expressed in a dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the condition."}]
