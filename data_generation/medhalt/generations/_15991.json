It is caused by mutations in the gene for the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which is involved in the development of male reproductive organs.

As a result, individuals with Reifenstein syndrome often have underdeveloped or absent testes, as well as other physical abnormalities such as hypospadias (a condition in which the opening of the urethra is located on the underside of the penis instead of the tip).
