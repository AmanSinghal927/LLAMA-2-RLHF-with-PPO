The patient's recurrent nightmares, avoidance of news coverage on the war, and angry outbursts are also indicative of PTSD. The other options are not as specific or accurate in diagnosing the patient's condition.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The duration of symptoms is important in correctly diagnosing the patient's condition because post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by symptoms that last for more than 1 month. The patient has been experiencing symptoms for 2 weeks, which is within the range of PTSD. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of recurrent nightmares and avoidance of triggers are consistent with PTSD. The other options are not as specific to PTSD.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The patient's avoidance of triggers is a key symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event, such as combat. The avoidance of triggers, such as news coverage of the war, is a common way that people with PTSD try to avoid feeling overwhelmed by their memories and emotions. The other options are not as specific to PTSD.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The answer is D)Negative Mood because it is the most specific and relevant symptom to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The patient's recurrent nightmares, avoidance of news coverage, and angry outbursts are all classic symptoms of PTSD, but the negative mood is the most important finding. PTSD is characterized by a persistent and pervasive negative mood, which can include feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. The patient's negative mood is the most significant symptom in this case, as it is the primary feature of PTSD that is driving the other symptoms.\n\n"}, {"question": "Unit for\u00a0measurement of viscosity is", "correct_answer": "Equipoise", "options": ["A)Equipoise", "B)Megapoise", "C)Decapoise", "D)Centipoise"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Unit for\u00a0measurement of viscosity isA)Equipoise B)Megapoise C)Decapoise D)Centipoise\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the unit of viscosity is typically measured in units of poise, and 1 equipoise is equal to 1000 poise.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the unit of viscosity is typically measured in units of poise, and a megapoise is equal to 1,000,000 poise.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because the unit of viscosity is typically measured in centipoise (cP) or decapoise (dP), and the prefix \"deca\" means 10, so decapoise is 10 times larger than centipoise.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the unit of viscosity is typically measured in centipoise (cP) or millipoise (mP), and not in equipoise (B) or megapoise (C).\n\n"}, {"question": "The effect of a non-competitive inhibitor:", "correct_answer": "It is reversed by increasing the concentration of substrate versus that of the inhibitor.", "options": ["A)Decreases the value of the Vmax.", "B)It is reversed by increasing the concentration of substrate versus that of the inhibitor.", "C)It does not affect the concentration of substrate that is required for the enzyme to reach Vi = 1 / 2Vmax.", "D)It is independent of substrate concentration."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:The effect of a non-competitive inhibitor:A)Decreases the value of the Vmax.
