The patient's 24-hour urine volume was 2100 mL, which is relatively low, indicating that the patient's proteinuria is not due to an excessive amount of urine production. Therefore, the patient's proteinuria is likely due to a leak of plasma proteins into the urine, which is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome. The patient's serum creatinine is 1 mg / dL, which is normal, indicating that the patient's kidney function is not impaired.
