This is because the Hb molecule has a specific site for binding oxygen, and when one oxygen molecule binds to this site, it causes a change in the conformation of the Hb molecule that affects the binding of additional oxygen molecules. As a result, the dissociation curve is characterized by a high affinity for oxygen at low concentrations and a decreasing affinity at higher concentrations.\n\n", "output4": "\n\n"}, {"question": "Elevations found on tooth surface leading to occlusal developmental groove:", "correct_answer": "Tubercle", "options": ["A)Cusp", "B)Fossa", "C)Ridge", "D)Tubercle"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Elevations found on tooth surface leading to occlusal developmental groove:A)Cusp B)Fossa C)Ridge D)Tubercle\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the elevations found on the tooth surface can be cusps, which are the raised areas on the tooth surface that can be seen in the occlusal view.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the fossa is a depression or groove on the tooth surface, and the occlusal developmental groove is a groove that forms on the occlusal surface of the tooth during development.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the elevations found on the tooth surface leading to occlusal developmental groove are called ridges.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the tubercle is a small, rounded elevation on the tooth surface that can lead to the development of an occlusal developmental groove.
