Bilirubin is a breakdown product of hemoglobin and it is normally excreted in the bile. However, when there is a blockage in the bile ducts, such as in the patient's case, bilirubin can accumulate in the blood and cause toxicity. The patient's history of acute hepatitis B 20 years ago may have caused chronic inflammation and scarring of the liver, which can lead to bile duct obstruction and bilirubin accumulation. The patient's symptoms of early satiety, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal bloating are also consistent with bile duct obstruction.

Additionally, the patient's symptoms of early satiety, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal bloating are consistent with a diagnosis of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), which is a common complication of heavy alcohol use.
