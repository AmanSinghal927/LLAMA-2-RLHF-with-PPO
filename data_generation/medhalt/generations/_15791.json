These therapies use well-established procedures that have been extensively evaluated through research. In contrast, hypnotherapy and auditory integration therapy have not been as extensively studied and are not widely recognized as effective treatments for autism. Occupational therapy can also be beneficial, but it is not specifically designed to address the core symptoms of autism.\n\n", "output4": "\n\n"}, {"question": "LacY in Lac Operon codes for ?", "correct_answer": "Thiogalactoside Transacetylase", "options": ["A)Galactoside Permease", "B)B Galactosidase", "C)Thiogalactoside Transacetylase", "D)Repressor"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:LacY in Lac Operon codes for ?A)Galactoside Permease B)B Galactosidase C)Thiogalactoside Transacetylase D)Repressor\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because LacY is a galactoside permease, it is responsible for the transport of galactose into the cell.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the LacY protein is a galactosidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose to galactose and glucose.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the LacY gene in the Lac operon codes for a thiogalactoside transacetylase enzyme, which is responsible for catalyzing the formation of thiogalactoside from galactose and acetyl-CoA.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: LacY is a repressor protein that binds to the lac operator and prevents the transcription of the lac genes.\n\n"}, {"question": "Ankle reflex is affected in prolapsed interveebral disc at what level?", "correct_answer": "L4 - L5", "options": ["A)L3 - L4", "B)L5 - S1", "C)S1 - S2", "D)L4 - L5"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Ankle reflex is affected in prolapsed interveebral disc at what level?A)L3 - L4 B)L5 - S1 C)S1 - S2 D)L4 - L5\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The ankle reflex is affected in prolapsed intervertebral disc at the L3-L4 level because the L4 nerve root is compressed, which can cause a decrease in the ankle reflex.\n\n", "output2": "A)The ankle reflex is mediated by the L5-S1 nerve roots.B)The L5-S1 disc is more prone to prolapse than other discs.C)The S1 nerve root is more important for ankle reflex than other nerve roots.D)All of the above\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The ankle reflex is affected in prolapsed intervertebral disc at the S1 - S2 level because the S1 and S2 spinal nerves are responsible for controlling the ankle muscles.
