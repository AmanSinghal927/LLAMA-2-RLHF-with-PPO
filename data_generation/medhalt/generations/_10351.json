This is a condition that occurs when the nerves in the lower back are compressed or damaged, leading to symptoms such as numbness, weakness, and paralysis in the lower extremities.

The patient's symptoms of upper limb weakness and difficulty eating on their own are consistent with central cord syndrome. Additionally, the fact that the patient can walk, despite having neck pain and weakness in the upper limbs, is also consistent with central cord syndrome, as this condition can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the severity of the injury.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Anterior spinal syndrome is characterized by a loss of motor and sensory function in the anterior (front) portion of the spinal cord, which can cause weakness and paralysis of the muscles of the upper limbs, as well as sensory loss in the upper limbs and trunk.
