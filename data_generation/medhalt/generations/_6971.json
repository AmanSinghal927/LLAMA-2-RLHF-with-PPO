Therefore, calcitonin can decrease orthodontic tooth movement by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Calcitonin, oral contraceptive, and estrogen are all hormones that can decrease orthodontic tooth movement. Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that regulates the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. It can inhibit the activity of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone, and thus can slow down the rate of tooth movement. Oral contraceptives contain estrogen and progesterone, which can also inhibit the activity of osteoclasts and slow down tooth movement. Estrogen, in particular, can increase the expression of certain genes that are involved in the regulation of tooth movement.
