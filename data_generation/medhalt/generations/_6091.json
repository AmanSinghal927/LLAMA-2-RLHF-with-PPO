Amperometric detectors are suitable for this technique because they measure the current flowing through the solution, which is directly proportional to the concentration of ions. Spectrophotometric detectors, on the other hand, measure the absorbance of light by the analytes, which may not be directly proportional to the concentration of ions. Conductivity detectors measure the conductivity of the solution, which is affected by the presence of ions, but may not provide a direct measurement of the analyte concentration. Flame ionization detectors are not suitable for this technique because they require high temperatures, which can destroy the ionic strength of the sample.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: In ion chromatography with suppressor columns, conductivity detectors are used because they are sensitive to the conductivity changes in the eluent as the ions pass through the column. The suppressor columns contain a high concentration of organic modifier, which reduces the conductivity of the eluent.
