This means that ions are more easily diffused by the stationary phase, leading to a greater broadening of the band. In gas chromatography, the mobile phase is typically a gas, so the DM diffusion coefficient is not a significant factor in band broadening. In liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is a liquid, so the DM diffusion coefficient can have some influence on band broadening, but it is not as significant as in ion chromatography.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The diffusion coefficient is higher in gas chromatography than in liquid chromatography, because the mobile phase in gas chromatography is a gas, which is more easily diffused than the mobile phase in liquid chromatography.
