By inhibiting DNA gyrase, macrolides prevent the unwinding of DNA, leading to the formation of supercoiled DNA.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Aminoglycosides bind to the A subunit of DNA gyrase, which is responsible for the negative supercoiling of DNA. By inhibiting the activity of DNA gyrase, aminoglycosides prevent the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, leading to the accumulation of negative supercoils and the formation of double-stranded breaks.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, inhibit the activity of DNA gyrase, which is responsible for the supercoiling of DNA. By inhibiting DNA gyrase, the fluoroquinolones prevent the bacteria from correctly supercoiling their DNA, leading to the formation of double-stranded breaks and ultimately cell death.\n\n"}, {"question": "Radioiodine preferred in treatment in", "correct_answer": "Young patients", "options": ["A)Recent onset of toxic goiter", "B)Post surgery for papillary thyroid cancer", "C)Pregnancy", "D)Young patients"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Radioiodine preferred in treatment inA)Recent onset of toxic goiter B)Post surgery for papillary thyroid cancer C)Pregnancy D)Young patients\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Radioiodine is preferred in recent onset of toxic goiter because it can quickly and effectively destroy the excess thyroid tissue, reducing symptoms and preventing long-term complications. Additionally, radioiodine is more effective than antithyroid medications in treating recent onset of toxic goiter.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because radioiodine is more effective in destroying any remaining thyroid tissue after surgery, reducing the risk of recurrence.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Radioiodine is not recommended during pregnancy because it can cause fetal thyroid gland abnormalities and intellectual disability.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Radioiodine is not recommended in young patients due to the risk of thyroid cancer.\n\n"}, {"question": "A person who was physically dependent on  heroin is now maintained on methadone.

This can cause rapid withdrawal symptoms in someone who is physically dependent on opioids.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because meperidine is a synthetic opioid that is rapidly metabolized to normeperidine, which can cause withdrawal symptoms. The other options, pentazocine, codeine, and heroin, are all natural opioids that are metabolized more slowly and are less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms immediately after use.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Codeine is a shorter-acting opioid than heroin, and its withdrawal symptoms will begin more quickly if the person stops taking it. The person who was physically dependent on heroin would have developed a tolerance to its longer-acting effects, and would have a more rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms if they took codeine.\n\n", "output4": "A) Because heroin is a full agonist and has no ceiling effect, so he will rapidly go into withdrawal.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a neuroendocrine tumors immunohistochemical markers?", "correct_answer": "chromogranin A", "options": ["A)synaptophysin", "B)CD7", "C)neuron-specific enolase", "D)chromogranin A"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is not a neuroendocrine tumors immunohistochemical markers?A)synaptophysin B)CD7 C)neuron-specific enolase D)chromogranin A\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because synaptophysin is a marker for neurons, not for neuroendocrine tumors.

Reamers, on the other hand, are used to remove bone spurs and other irregularities from the wound bed.
