It has a high degree of ductility and can be bent multiple times without losing its shape. In contrast, stainless steel and Cr-Co-Ni are brittle materials that can break easily when bent. Ni-Ti is also a shape memory alloy, but it is not as ductile as beta-titanium.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Stainless steel has a higher ductility than the other materials listed, which means it can be bent more times before it breaks.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because Ni-Ti is a shape memory alloy that can undergo a large number of cycles of bending without fracturing, due to its ability to undergo plastic deformation.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The reason is that the alloy D)Cr-Co-Ni has a higher ductility than the other options. Ductility is a measure of a material's ability to bend without breaking, and it is determined by the material's elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and the amount of strain hardening that occurs in the material. In this case, the Cr-Co-Ni alloy has a higher elastic modulus and a lower Poisson's ratio, which makes it more ductile than the other options. Additionally, the Cr-Co-Ni alloy undergoes less strain hardening, which means that it can be bent more times before it reaches its breaking point.\n\n"}, {"question": "When treating a primary alcohol with HBr, the corresponding haloalkane is normally obtained by SN2 reaction through:", "correct_answer": "Alkyl anion.", "options": ["A)Alkyloxonium anion.", "B)Radical alkyloxonium.", "C)Alkyl anion.", "D)Ion alkoxonium."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:When treating a primary alcohol with HBr, the corresponding haloalkane is normally obtained by SN2 reaction through:A)Alkyloxonium anion.
