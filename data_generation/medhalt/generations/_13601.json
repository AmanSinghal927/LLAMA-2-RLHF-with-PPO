They have a larger base of support and can bear more weight than other ambulation aids like canes or crutches. Additionally, walkers have a more stable and wider base, which helps to distribute the weight evenly and reduce the risk of falls.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because a cane provides maximum load-bearing capacity compared to other walking aids, such as walkers and crutches, as it transfers the weight of the body to the ground through the handle and the shaft, allowing for more weight support and stability. Additionally, the cane provides a larger surface area for weight distribution, which reduces the risk of pressure ulcers and skin breakdown.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Axillary crutches provide maximum load-bearing support because they are designed to support the weight of the body through the axilla (armpit) and the shoulder, which are strong and stable joints that can bear a significant amount of weight. In contrast, walkers and canes provide support through the legs and lower body, which may not be able to bear as much weight, especially for individuals with mobility issues or weakness in their legs. Upper arm crutches, on the other hand, provide support through the upper arm and forearm, but may not be able to bear as much weight as axillary crutches.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A:\n\n"}, {"question": "Fracture passing through mental foramen in mandible with less than 10 mm of bone can be best managed by", "correct_answer": "Lag screws", "options": ["A)MMF", "B)Lag screws", "C)Reconstruction plate", "D)3-D plate"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Fracture passing through mental foramen in mandible with less than 10 mm of bone can be best managed byA)MMF B)Lag screws C)Reconstruction plate D)3-D plate\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the fracture is less than 10 mm in length, and the mental foramen is a critical structure that should be preserved.
