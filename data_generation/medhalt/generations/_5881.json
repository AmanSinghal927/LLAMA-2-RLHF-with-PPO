[{"question": "Which of the following is most abundant end product of fatty acid synthesis -", "correct_answer": "Glucose", "options": ["A)Glucose", "B)Oleic acid", "C)Palmitic acid", "D)Arachidonic acid"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is most abundant end product of fatty acid synthesis -A)Glucose B)Oleic acid C)Palmitic acid D)Arachidonic acid\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Fatty acid synthesis is the process by which cells produce fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. The end product of this process is not a fatty acid, but rather glucose. This is because the fatty acid synthesis pathway is an anabolic pathway, meaning it builds up molecules from smaller units. The starting material for this pathway is acetyl-CoA, which is derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates. The end product of the pathway is glucose, which is then used to produce energy or stored for later use.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Oleic acid is the most abundant end product of fatty acid synthesis because it is a monounsaturated fatty acid, which is the most common type of fatty acid found in nature. Additionally, oleic acid is the most stable form of fatty acid, which means it is less likely to be broken down into other fatty acids or oxidized.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Palmitic acid is the most abundant end product of fatty acid synthesis because it is the major component of triacylglycerols, which are the primary storage form of fat in the body.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the fatty acid synthesis pathway is a complex process that involves several enzymes and substrates. The end product of this pathway is arachidonic acid, which is a 20-carbon fatty acid. This is because the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, preferentially synthesizes arachidonic acid from the precursor molecules. Additionally, arachidonic acid is a key intermediate in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are important signaling molecules in the body.\n\n"}, {"question": "Gutta Percha can effectively be sterilized by?", "correct_answer": "Autoclaving", "options": ["A)Dry heat", "B)Autoclaving", "C)Chemical solutions", "D)Hot salt sterilizer"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Gutta Percha can effectively be sterilized by?A)Dry heat B)Autoclaving C)Chemical solutions D)Hot salt sterilizer\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because dry heat is the most effective method for sterilizing gutta percha, as it can kill all microorganisms and viruses without causing any damage to the material.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Gutta Percha is a thermoplastic material that can be sterilized by heat, and autoclaving is a method of sterilizing with high pressure steam.
