As a result, the pressure within the pleural space (intrapleural pressure) is increased to compensate for the reduced airflow. Therefore, the intrapleural pressure in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease is likely to be larger than in normal subjects.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because in chronic obstructive lung disease, the airways are partially blocked, which causes the lung tissue to overinflate, leading to an increase in intrapleural pressure (Pip). This increase in Pip is balanced by an increase in the volume of the lung, so that the same amount of ventilation can be achieved as in normal subjects. Therefore, the change in Pip is equal to the change in the volume of the lung.\n\n"}, {"question": "To an extreme form of agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces, it is called:", "correct_answer": "Caragnosia.", "options": ["A)Caragnosia.", "B)Prosopagnosia", "C)Paragnosia", "D)Anosognosia"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:To an extreme form of agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces, it is called:A)Caragnosia.
