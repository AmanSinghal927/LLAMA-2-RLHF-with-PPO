Additionally, diphenhydramine has been shown to be effective in treating these symptoms in patients with seasonal allergies.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that is less likely to cause drowsiness compared to other antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and cetirizine. It is also a first-generation antihistamine, which has a more selective effect on histamine receptors and is less likely to cause sedation.

The indicator electrodes are used to indicate the end points of the titration, and they are not affected by the potential changes at i = 0. Therefore, the use of two indicator electrodes can provide the same information as a reference electrode.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a spine of exercise?", "correct_answer": "Song (flexion)", "options": ["A)Song (flexion)", "B)Rotation (rotation)", "C)Extension (extension)", "D)Rotary (circumduction)"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is not a spine of exercise?A)Song (flexion) B)Rotation (rotation) C)Extension (extension) D)Rotary (circumduction)\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because song is not a type of exercise, it's a type of music.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because rotational movements are not typically considered to be spine exercises.
