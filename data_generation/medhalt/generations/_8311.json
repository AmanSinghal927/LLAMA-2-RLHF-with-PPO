The humeral head is surrounded by a thin layer of cartilage, which can be easily damaged, leading to AVN. Additionally, the proximal humerus receives a relatively low blood supply compared to other bones in the body, making it more susceptible to AVN. Therefore, out of the options given, the two-part fracture has the maximum chances of AVN.\n\n", "output4": "\n\n"}, {"question": "Fastest receptor mediated action is through ?", "correct_answer": "Intracellular receptors", "options": ["A)Intrinsic ion channels", "B)Enzyme linked receptors", "C)Intracellular receptors", "D)Cell membrane receptors"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Fastest receptor mediated action is through ?A)Intrinsic ion channels B)Enzyme linked receptors C)Intracellular receptors D)Cell membrane receptors\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot> A: Because intrinsic ion channels are directly linked to the ion channels in the cell membrane, allowing for rapid and direct communication between the extracellular environment and the intracellular compartment.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because enzyme linked receptors are directly connected to the intracellular signaling pathways, allowing for the fastest possible response to the signal.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Intracellular receptors are more sensitive to the binding of ligands and can activate signaling pathways more quickly than other types of receptors.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because cell membrane receptors are directly connected to the plasma membrane and can trigger an action potential in the cell.\n\n"}, {"question": "False about Pott's spine", "correct_answer": "Back pain is an early symptom", "options": ["A)There is disc space narrowing on x-ray", "B)Back pain is an early symptom", "C)Always heals by chemotherapy", "D)Commonest at dorsolumbar junction"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:False about Pott's spineA)There is disc space narrowing on x-ray B)Back pain is an early symptom C)Always heals by chemotherapy D)Commonest at dorsolumbar junction\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because Pott's spine is characterized by disc space narrowing on x-ray.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because back pain is a common early symptom of Pott's spine, and it is often the presenting symptom.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because Pott's spine is a type of tuberculosis that affects the spine, and chemotherapy is the most effective treatment for tuberculosis.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the disc space narrowing is most common at the dorsolumbar junction, which is the area where the thoracic and lumbar spine meet.\n\n"}, {"question": "Chronic alcoholic comes with pain epigastrium and recurrent vomiting.

An alcohol breath test can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of the symptoms.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the patient's symptoms of epigastric pain and recurrent vomiting are consistent with a gastrointestinal cause, and UGI endoscopy can help to identify the cause of the symptoms. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic alcohol consumption suggests that there may be underlying gastrointestinal damage or inflammation that can be evaluated with UGI endoscopy.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: The patient has a history of chronic alcoholism, which increases the likelihood of alcohol-related liver disease. The presence of epigastric pain and recurrent vomiting suggest that the patient may have developed a gastric or duodenal ulcer. The normal chest X-ray does not rule out the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed. Therefore, a CECT scan is the next best step to evaluate the patient's abdominal organs and identify any potential bleeding sources.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because serum lipase is elevated in alcohol-related pancreatitis, which is a common complication of chronic alcoholism. The other options are not specific to alcohol-related pancreatitis. A) Alcohol breath test is not specific to alcohol-related pancreatitis.

The test is based on the assumption that the subject's unconscious mind will be revealed through their interpretation of the fables, and that the subject's emotional state and conflicts will be reflected in their responses. Therefore, the test is considered a cathartic technique, as it allows the subject to express and release their emotions in a safe and controlled environment.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The D\u00fcss's Fables test is a form of projective technique that allows the respondent to express their thoughts and feelings in a way that is not explicitly structured or guided. It is based on the idea that the respondent's drawings or stories about a series of fables will reveal their unconscious thoughts and feelings about themselves and their relationships with others. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Expressive.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The D\u00fcss's Fables test is a projective technique that involves asking the respondent to describe a series of fables in their own words. The technique is based on the assumption that the way a person describes a fable will reveal their underlying thoughts, feelings, and motivations. The technique is associative because it relies on the respondent's subjective interpretation of the fables, rather than a rigid, structured analysis.\n\n"}, {"question": "What is the most frequent configuration of the peptide bond in proteins ?:", "correct_answer": "The cis form in animal proteins and the trans form in plants.", "options": ["A)The trans configuration", "B)The cis and trans forms are equally frequent.", "C)The cis form in animal proteins and the trans form in plants.", "D)The cis configuration."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:What is the most frequent configuration of the peptide bond in proteins ?:A)The trans configuration B)The cis and trans forms are equally frequent.

D)The cis configuration.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: In a protein, the peptide bond is formed between two amino acids, one from the N-terminus and one from the C-terminus. The peptide bond is formed by the condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the other. In the trans configuration, the carboxyl group and the amino group are on opposite sides of the peptide bond, which is the most stable conformation. Therefore, the trans configuration is the most frequent configuration of the peptide bond in proteins.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the peptide bond can adopt both trans and cis configurations, and the frequency of each configuration depends on the specific protein and the conditions under which it is formed. There is no specific prevalence of one configuration over the other in proteins.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the cis form is more stable in the presence of water, and plant proteins are more exposed to water than animal proteins.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: In proteins, the peptide bond is formed between the carbonyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another.
