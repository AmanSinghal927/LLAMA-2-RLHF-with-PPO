D)In aqueous solution they have an acid character and their acid strength increases according to HF <HCI <HBr <HI.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because hydrogen halides are polar molecules and hydrogen bonds are formed between the polar molecules.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the halogen atoms in HF, HCl, HBr, and HI are in their highest oxidation states +1, +1, +1, and +1 respectively, which means they are the result of the oxidation of the corresponding halogen atoms.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because hydrogen halides are polar compounds and the intermolecular forces between them are relatively weak, so they can exist as liquids at room temperature.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: That's because the acid strength of a hydrogen halide in aqueous solution is determined by the ability of the hydrogen atom to donate a proton (H+) to water molecules. In general, the larger the halogen atom, the more easily it can attract a proton, and therefore the stronger the acid.\n\n"}, {"question": "If the drug  is delivered  in the area for less then 24hours is known as:", "correct_answer": "Initial drug release", "options": ["A)Slow drug release", "B)Controlled drug release", "C)Initial drug release", "D)Sustained drug  release"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:If the drug  is delivered  in the area for less then 24hours is known as:A)Slow drug release B)Controlled drug release C)Initial drug release D)Sustained drug  release\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the drug is delivered in the area for less than 24 hours, which allows for a slower release of the drug over time.\n</bot></human>\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the drug is delivered in the area for less than 24 hours, which allows for a controlled release of the drug over a specific period of time.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the drug is delivered in the area for less than 24 hours, it is released initially and then the effect wears off.\n\n", "output4": "\n\n"}, {"question": "A chemical element whose atomic number is Z disintegrates by releasing a beta particle.
