This is because the urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, have a cell wall that contains D-ala D-ala.

Ciprofloxacin inhibits the initiation complex of peptidoglycan synthesis, which is required for bacterial cell wall synthesis.
