This can result in the loss of supporting bone and gum tissue, leading to a decrease in the width of the periodontal ligament.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits will not cause any changes in the width of the periodontal ligament (PDL). The PDL is a fibrous tissue that adapts to the forces exerted upon it, but it will not undergo any changes in width due to excessive forces within physiological limits.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: When excessive forces of occlusion are applied within physiological limits, the periodontal ligament (PDL) is subjected to increased stress. This can lead to a decrease in the width of the PDL, which can negatively impact the health of the periodontium.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When excessive forces of occlusion are applied within physiological limits, the periodontal ligament (PDL) is subjected to increased stress and strain. In response to this stress, the PDL undergoes changes that result in an increase in width. This is because the PDL is able to stretch and accommodate the increased forces, allowing the tooth to remain in place.\n\n"}, {"question": "Thick pasty saliva is due to:", "correct_answer": "Both.", "options": ["A)Both.", "B)Parasympathetic stimulation.", "C)Reflex sympathetic stimulation.", "D)None."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Thick pasty saliva is due to:A)Both. B)Parasympathetic stimulation. C)Reflex sympathetic stimulation. D)None.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Thick pasty saliva is due to both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation.

When the body is under stress, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, leading to increased salivation. This is known as the \"fight or flight\" response. The saliva produced during this response is thicker and more viscous than normal saliva, which is due to the increased levels of the hormone adrenaline. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Reflex sympathetic stimulation.", "output4": "\n<bot>: Thick pasty saliva is not a normal physiological response.
