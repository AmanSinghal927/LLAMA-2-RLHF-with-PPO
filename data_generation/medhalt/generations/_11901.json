This suggests that the hypertension may be secondary to another cause, such as a renal or endocrine disorder. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider a study to rule out these causes and potentially add a fourth drug to the treatment regimen.\n<human>: Thank you!\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the patient has a high blood pressure despite being treated with three drugs at full doses, and the 24-hour ABPM shows a high average blood pressure, especially during sleep.
