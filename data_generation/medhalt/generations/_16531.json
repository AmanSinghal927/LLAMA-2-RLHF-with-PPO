Therefore, immediate lung CT scan is not necessary.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because the option D describes the correct sequence of events for the treatment of congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). CPAM is a rare congenital malformation that affects the airways and can cause respiratory distress and other complications. The treatment of CPAM typically involves a series of diagnostic tests and interventions, including prenatal ultrasound, neonatal chest X-ray, and CT scans. In the case of a neonatal prenatal suspect left upper lobe small vesicular lesions, the appropriate course of action would be to accept CT 6 months old when diagnosed after birth, and then undergo operation again after 2 years. This is because the small vesicular lesions are likely to be a sign of CPAM, and the operation is necessary to correct the malformation and prevent further complications.\n\n"}, {"question": "The sterilization method for the instruments which are damaged by dry heat is:", "correct_answer": "Steam", "options": ["A)Radiation", "B)Boiling", "C)Steam", "D)Burning"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:The sterilization method for the instruments which are damaged by dry heat is:A)Radiation B)Boiling C)Steam D)Burning\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because radiation is a method of sterilization that uses high-energy electromagnetic radiation to kill microorganisms, and it is effective against heat-sensitive instruments.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because boiling is a method of sterilization that uses heat to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, and it is effective against heat-resistant microorganisms like those that may be present on damaged instruments.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because steam sterilization is effective against heat-sensitive instruments, and it is also effective against bacterial spores, which are resistant to dry heat.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because burning is a method of sterilization that involves the use of heat to kill all microorganisms, including those that may be resistant to dry heat.\n\n"}, {"question": "Charge transferred across rows of detector in a 'Bucket brigade' fashion is seen in:", "correct_answer": "CMOS", "options": ["A)CMOS", "B)Flat panel detector", "C)PSP", "D)CCD"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Charge transferred across rows of detector in a 'Bucket brigade' fashion is seen in:A)CMOS B)Flat panel detector C)PSP D)CCD\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the charge is transferred across rows of the detector in a \"bucket brigade\" fashion in CMOS image sensors.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the flat panel detector is a type of CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) detector that uses a bucket brigade approach to transfer charge across rows.
