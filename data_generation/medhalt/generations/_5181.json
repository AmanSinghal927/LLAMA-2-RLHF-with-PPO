Heparin, on the other hand, is a direct thrombin inhibitor and it does cross the placenta, so it is excreted in breast milk. Naloxone and morphine are both opioid antagonists and they do not cross the placenta either.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Heparin is a large molecule that cannot cross the placenta, whereas the other drugs (warfarin, naloxone, and morphine) can cross the placenta and reach the fetus.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Naloxone is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, which means it binds to the mu-opioid receptor and prevents the binding of endogenous opioids, such as endorphins. Since endorphins are produced by the body and do not cross the placenta, Naloxone does not cross the placenta either.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Morphine is a lipophilic drug, meaning it is not easily soluble in water and therefore cannot cross the placenta.\n<human>"}, {"question": "Identify a phagocytic receptor:", "correct_answer": "NLR (NOD-Like Receiver).", "options": ["A)NLR (NOD-Like Receiver).", "B)Mannose receiver", "C)TLR-3 (Toll-Like Receiver).", "D)Fc\u03b5R."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Identify a phagocytic receptor:A)NLR (NOD-Like Receiver).
