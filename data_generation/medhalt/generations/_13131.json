The blood that is drawn from the pulmonary artery is a mixture of venous blood that has been deoxygenated by the lungs and arterial blood that has been oxygenated by the lungs. The oxygen content of the blood is often decreased because of the left-to-right shunt, which allows oxygen-poor blood from the left side of the heart to mix with oxygen-rich blood from the right side of the heart.
