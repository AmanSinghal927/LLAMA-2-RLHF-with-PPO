In the case of \"I savo\", the child is using the word \"savo\" which is a basic form of \"know\", instead of the more complex form \"I know\". This is an example of overextension, where the child is using a word or phrase that is not fully developed in their language system.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: When children are learning language, they may apply rules too strictly, resulting in overregulated speech.

As a result, they may produce errors that are the opposite of what they intended, such as \"I savo\" instead of \"I know\".
