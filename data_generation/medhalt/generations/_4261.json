When the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood is low, the carotid body sends a signal to the brain to increase respiration and increase blood flow to the lungs. This is because the low partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood indicates that the body is not getting enough oxygen, and the brain needs to take action to correct this.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of following is an analouge guanosine ?", "correct_answer": "Allopurinol", "options": ["A)Abacavir", "B)Bromodeoxyuridine", "C)Allopurinol", "D)None"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of following is an analouge guanosine ?A)Abacavir B)Bromodeoxyuridine C)Allopurinol D)None\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Abacavir is an analogue of guanosine because it has a similar structure to guanosine and is incorporated into DNA in a similar way.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Bromodeoxyuridine is an analogue of guanosine because it has a similar chemical structure and is incorporated into DNA in a similar way.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Allopurinol is an analogue of guanosine because it has a similar chemical structure and is metabolized to form the same compound as guanosine.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Guanosine is a purine base, and none of the options A-C are analogs of guanosine.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 27-year-old man and his wife present to an infertility clinic for evaluation after they tried unsuccessfully to conceive for 2 years.

In addition, azoospermia is a common finding in hypogonadism, which is consistent with the patient's diagnosis.
