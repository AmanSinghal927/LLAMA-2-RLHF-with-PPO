When the patient takes propranolol before a public speaking event, it will increase his cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute) and increase his peripheral resistance (the opposition to blood flow in the blood vessels). This will help to counteract the effects of the stress response, which would otherwise cause his heart rate and blood pressure to increase, and his diaphoresis to worsen.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which means it blocks the effects of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) on the heart. When the patient takes propranolol before public speaking, it will decrease his heart rate and cardiac output, and increase his peripheral resistance.

Adrenaline causes an increase in heart rate and cardiac output, as well as an increase in peripheral resistance.

This is why propranolol is often used to treat hypertension, angina, and anxiety disorders.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which means it blocks the effects of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) on the heart. When the patient takes propranolol before a public speaking event, it will decrease his heart rate and decrease the force of his heart's contractions, which will lead to a decrease in cardiac output. Additionally, propranolol will cause peripheral resistance to increase, which will further decrease blood flow to the body's tissues.\n<human>"}, {"question": "For soldering an orthodontic wire, the solder and flux used are:", "correct_answer": "Silver is used as solder and borax as flux", "options": ["A)Gold is used as solder and borax as flux", "B)Gold is used as solder and fluoride as flux", "C)Silver is used as solder and fluoride as flux", "D)Silver is used as solder and borax as flux"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:For soldering an orthodontic wire, the solder and flux used are:A)Gold is used as solder and borax as flux B)Gold is used as solder and fluoride as flux C)Silver is used as solder and fluoride as flux D)Silver is used as solder and borax as flux\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because gold is a good conductor of electricity and has a high melting point, making it a suitable material for soldering.
