It is a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to complications such as preterm labor, growth restriction, and placental abruption. These complications can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby. Therefore, pregnancies with a history of antenatal preeclampsia are considered high-risk.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: That's because the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth increases with the number of previous pregnancies. Women who have had two or more previous pregnancies are considered high-risk for complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preterm labor.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth is higher for working mothers due to various factors such as stress, poor nutrition, and lack of proper prenatal care.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Twins are considered high risk because they are more likely to be born prematurely, have low birth weight, and experience other complications such as respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n"}, {"question": "65-year-old female, both sides of the pleural effusion, which contains lower protein concentration.
