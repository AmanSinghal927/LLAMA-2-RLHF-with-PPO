Sulfonamides work by inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid, a crucial nutrient for bacterial growth. Since bacteria need folic acid to survive, the inhibition of its synthesis by sulfonamides leads to resistance to these antibiotics. Thymidine is not directly involved in the synthesis of folic acid, so it does not confer resistance to sulfonamides.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Erythromycin is an antibiotic that inhibits the synthesis of DNA by binding to the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Thymidine is a nucleoside that is incorporated into DNA during replication.
