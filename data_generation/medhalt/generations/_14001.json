The dentin layers are deposited on top of the dental pulp, and their thickness and size ultimately determine the size of the tooth.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: During the stage of calcification, the tooth is formed from the dental papilla, which is the mass of cells that will eventually become the dentin, enamel, and cementum. The size of the tooth is determined by the amount of dental papilla present, which in turn is determined by the amount of calcium and phosphorus ions available for mineralization.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: During morpho differentiation, the tooth bud undergoes a series of complex cellular and molecular events that ultimately lead to the formation of the tooth's size and shape.
