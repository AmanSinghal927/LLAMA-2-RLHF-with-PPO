In elderly individuals, the pituitary gland can become hypertrophic, leading to an increase in the size of the mandible. This condition is known as hyperpituitarism.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The increase in height of the mandible with age is due to the progressive growth of the mandibular condyle, which is stimulated by thyroid hormones. Hyperthyroidism, characterized by an excess of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increase in the growth and development of bones, including the mandible. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because hyperparathyroidism is associated with an increase in height of the mandible, as well as an increase in interdental spaces. This is due to the fact that parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the growth and development of bone tissue. As PTH levels increase, the bone tissue in the mandible and other areas of the body also increase, leading to an increase in height. Additionally, PTH also causes the bones in the face to grow and develop, leading to an increase in interdental spaces.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The mandible is the bone that is most affected by hypopituitarism, and it can cause a decrease in height. As the interdental spaces increase, it can be an indication of hypopituitarism.\n\n"}, {"question": "ADA specification of orthodontic wire:", "correct_answer": "30", "options": ["A)32", "B)30", "C)25", "D)29"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:ADA specification of orthodontic wire:A)32 B)30 C)25 D)29\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the ADA specification for orthodontic wire is 32.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because 30 is the standard size for orthodontic wires, and the other options are not commonly used or recommended.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the ADA specification for orthodontic wire is 25 gauge.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the ADA specification for orthodontic wire is 29.\n\n"}, {"question": "Use of ribavirin to treat hepatitis biggest side effects:", "correct_answer": "Thrombocytopenia", "options": ["A)Thrombocytopenia", "B)Leukopenia", "C)Prothrombin time (prothrombin time) extended", "D)anemia"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Use of ribavirin to treat hepatitis biggest side effects:A)Thrombocytopenia B)Leukopenia C)Prothrombin time (prothrombin time) extended D)anemia\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Ribavirin is known to cause thrombocytopenia, which is a decrease in platelet count.

Thank you!\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Ribavirin can cause anemia as a side effect, particularly in patients with pre-existing anemia or in those who receive high doses of the drug. This is because ribavirin can inhibit the production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells. As a result, the body may not produce enough red blood cells, leading to anemia.\n\n"}, {"question": "All are true about baroreceptors, expect ?", "correct_answer": "Stimulation causes increased vagal discharge", "options": ["A)Stimulate nucleus ambiguous", "B)Stimulation causes increased vagal discharge", "C)Afferents are through sino-aoic nerves", "D)Stimulated when BP decreases"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:All are true about baroreceptors, expect ?A)Stimulate nucleus ambiguous B)Stimulation causes increased vagal discharge C)Afferents are through sino-aoic nerves D)Stimulated when BP decreases\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the nucleus ambiguus is not a specific structure that is stimulated by baroreceptors.
