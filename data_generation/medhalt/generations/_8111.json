This is because the basiocciput is a bony part of the skull that fuses with other bones during childhood and adolescence. The basisphenoid is a bone that forms the base of the skull and is also present in the early stages of fetal development. As the child grows, the basiocciput and basisphenoid fuse together to form a single bone. This process typically occurs between 18 and 22 years of age.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The basiocciput and basisphenoid fuse at 14 weeks of development, which is around the 14th week of gestation.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the basiocciput fuses with the basisphenoid between 14-16 years of age.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The basiocciput fuses with the basisphenoid between 22 and 25 years of age, during the late childhood and early adolescence.
