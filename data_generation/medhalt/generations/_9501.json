Vein of Galen malformation is a rare congenital anomaly that affects the vein of Galen, which is a large vein that drains blood from the brain to the heart. This malformation can cause a variety of symptoms, including congestive heart failure, bulging anterior fontanelle, and the presence of a bruit on auscultation. Medulloblastoma and arachnoid cyst are less likely diagnoses, as they do not typically present with these specific symptoms. Encephalocele is also less likely, as it is a more severe and rare condition that typically presents with a more obvious mass effect on the brain and skull.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which is true about selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with non-selective NSAIDs?", "correct_answer": "Thromboembolism decreased", "options": ["A)No anti-pyretic effect", "B)Similar renal toxicity", "C)High GI bleeding", "D)Thromboembolism decreased"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which is true about selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with non-selective NSAIDs?A)No anti-pyretic effect B)Similar renal toxicity C)High GI bleeding D)Thromboembolism decreased\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Selective COX-2 inhibitors only inhibit COX-2 enzyme, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins.
