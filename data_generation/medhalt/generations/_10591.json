D)Submucosal vital root retention.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Biologic denture therapy is a technique that involves using selected initial roots in overdenture therapy to improve the esthetics and function of the denture. By retaining the natural roots of the teeth, the denture is able to attach to the teeth more securely, which can improve the stability and retention of the denture. Additionally, the natural roots can help to stimulate the underlying bone, which can help to maintain the health of the jawbone and prevent bone loss.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because in submerged denture therapy, the selected initial roots are submerged in the denture base, allowing for better retention and support.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because in overdenture therapy, the denture is placed over the existing teeth, and the selected initial roots are used as a foundation for the denture.
