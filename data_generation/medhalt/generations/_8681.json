This can cause a variety of perceptual distortions, including the appearance of \"double vision\" or \"ghosting\" of objects.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the retina contains both red and green cones, and the visual cortex processes the signals from these cones to create a single visual image. When the retina receives different coloured images, the visual cortex projects these images onto the same visual field, creating the illusion of a single image. This is known as the \"projection of different coloured images into visual coex\".\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because Ansiokonia is a condition in which the visual field appears to be divided into two separate images, each with its own separate perspective, and this is a result of a problem with the visual pathway, specifically the optic nerve.

Therefore, no laboratory test can distinguish between staphylococci and micrococci.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The Coagulasetest is a differential test that distinguishes between staphylococci and micrococci based on the presence or absence of a specific enzyme (coagulase) produced by staphylococci.
