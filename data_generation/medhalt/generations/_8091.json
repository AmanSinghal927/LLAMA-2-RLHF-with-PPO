This allows the radiologist to assess the bladder's ability to empty and the presence of any reflux.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: An intravenous urogram is a radiological procedure that uses a contrast medium injected into a vein to visualize the urinary tract, including the bladder and ureters. It is the most appropriate procedure for studying vesico-ureteric reflux because it allows for detailed visualization of the ureters and bladder, as well as the ability to assess the pressure gradient between the bladder and the ureters. Additionally, it is a relatively simple and non-invasive procedure compared to other options like cystoscopy or ureteroscopy.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status.
