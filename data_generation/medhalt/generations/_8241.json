This means that IgG antibodies can remain in the body for a longer period of time compared to other antibodies such as IgE, which has a half-life of approximately 2-4 days. As a result, IgG antibodies are more likely to be present in the body for a longer period of time in cases of chronic allergies.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The reason is that lg E is a potent allergic mediator that can cause the release of histamine from mast cells, leading to the symptoms of allergic reactions.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The reason is that lg A is the most potent allergen among all the allergens you mentioned, and it is also the most common allergen responsible for chronic allergies.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Lg M is a type of immunoglobulin that is produced in response to parasitic infections, and it can persist in the body for longer periods of time compared to other immunoglobulins. In chronic allergies, the body may produce more Lg M in response to the persistent exposure to allergens, which can lead to its persistence in the body for longer periods.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 1-day-old male is seen in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress.
