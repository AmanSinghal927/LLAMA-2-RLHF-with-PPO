In the case of an acute myocardial infarction, the heart muscle is damaged, and fluid can accumulate in the pericardial sac, leading to cardiac tamponade. This can cause sudden death by compressing the heart and impairing its ability to pump blood effectively.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Aortic dissection is a catastrophic complication of acute myocardial infarction. It occurs when the infarcted myocardium weakens the aortic wall, leading to tearing of the aortic intima and media. This can cause sudden death due to massive bleeding into the pericardial space, leading to cardiac tamponade and compression of the heart.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Atrial fibrillation can lead to ventricular fibrillation, which is a leading cause of sudden death in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Additionally, atrial fibrillation can also lead to cardiac embolism, which can be fatal.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Ventricular fibrillation is a leading cause of sudden death in patients with acute myocardial infarction because it is a potentially lethal arrhythmia that can rapidly degenerate into asystole, leading to cardiac arrest and death.\n\n"}, {"question": "What is the proportion of patients with anorexia nervosa who develop bulimia nervosa ?:", "correct_answer": "Around 80% of patients.", "options": ["A)The totality of those patients.", "B)Around 50% of patients.", "C)Only 5% of patients.", "D)Around 80% of patients."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:What is the proportion of patients with anorexia nervosa who develop bulimia nervosa ?:A)The totality of those patients.
