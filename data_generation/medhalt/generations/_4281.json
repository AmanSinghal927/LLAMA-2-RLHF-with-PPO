Paial penectomy with a 2 cm margin is a more conservative approach than Paial penectomy with a 4 cm margin, which is usually recommended for low-grade cancer. Additionally, the patient's age is a factor, as he is 45 years old, which is considered a relatively young age for penile cancer. Therefore, the goal of treatment should be to preserve as much of the penis as possible while still ensuring adequate margins to prevent the cancer from recurring. Circumcision is not a suitable treatment option for this patient, as it would not provide the same level of tissue preservation as Paial penectomy with a 2 cm margin.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The correct answer is D)Paial penectomy with Inguinal nodes exploration because the patient has cancer extending upto the glans penis, which requires the removal of the entire glans penis and the surrounding tissue, including the inguinal nodes. Paial penectomy with a 2 cm margin would not be sufficient to remove the entire cancer, as the cancer extends beyond the 2 cm margin. Additionally, circumcision would not be an appropriate treatment for penile cancer, as it is not a curative procedure.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not used as an antiflux?", "correct_answer": "Calcium carbonate with alcohol", "options": ["A)Graphite", "B)Calcium carbonate with alcohol", "C)Boric acid", "D)Iron oxide"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is not used as an antiflux?A)Graphite B)Calcium carbonate with alcohol C)Boric acid D)Iron oxide\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Graphite is not used as an antiflux because it is not effective in reducing the flux of a liquid.
