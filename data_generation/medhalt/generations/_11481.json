This is because individuals with CODs often have persistent and intrusive thoughts or fears of harm coming to themselves or others, which can lead to a range of compulsive behaviors and avoidance strategies. Additionally, the expectation of harm and anxiety can be closely linked to the maladaptive belief of having excessive responsibility, as individuals may feel that they have a responsibility to prevent harm from occurring.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: In the cognitive model of Compulsive Obsessive Disorders, hypervigilance to the threatening stimuli of the environment is considered the most central element because it is the main factor that leads to the development and maintenance of obsessions and compulsions.
