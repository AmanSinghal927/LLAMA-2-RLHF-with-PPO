Additionally, educating patients can help to reduce the stigma associated with narcotics and encourage them to seek alternative pain management options.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because education and awareness are key to changing prescribing practices and reducing the number of days given for narcotic pain medication prescriptions in the emergency department. By notifying all providers of best practices, they can make informed decisions about prescribing and avoid overprescribing.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because changing the electronic medical record (EMR) would be the most efficient and effective way to implement the change in prescribing practices. By limiting the number of days that can be prescribed in the EMR, providers will be forced to carefully consider the need for narcotic pain medication and the potential risks of addiction and overdose. Additionally, the EMR change would be a clear and consistent reminder to providers of the new prescribing guidelines, making it more likely that they will follow the guidelines.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because it is a tangible and visible reminder to providers of the dangers of narcotics and the importance of appropriate prescribing. Additionally, it may encourage providers to consider the risks of narcotics prescribing and make changes to their practice.\n\n"}, {"question": "Laryngeal mask airway is contraindicated in?", "correct_answer": "Difficult airways", "options": ["A)In CPR", "B)Pregnant female", "C)Difficult airways", "D)Ocular surgeries"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Laryngeal mask airway is contraindicated in?A)In CPR B)Pregnant female C)Difficult airways D)Ocular surgeries\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot> A: The laryngeal mask airway is not recommended for use in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) because it is difficult to place and maintain in the airway during CPR.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the laryngeal mask airway is contraindicated in pregnant females due to the risk of aspiration of amniotic fluid into the lungs.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because laryngeal mask airway is not recommended for patients with difficult airways due to the risk of laryngeal mask displacement or obstruction.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the laryngeal mask airway is a supraglottic airway device that is not designed for use in the presence of a surgical field, and could potentially cause damage to the eye or the surgical site.\n\n"}, {"question": "Depot preparations are administered by ?", "correct_answer": "Intravenous route", "options": ["A)Both subcutaneous and intramuscular route", "B)Subcutaneous route", "C)Intramuscular route", "D)Intravenous route"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Depot preparations are administered by ?A)Both subcutaneous and intramuscular route B)Subcutaneous route C)Intramuscular route D)Intravenous route\n\nA:", "output1": "\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because depot preparations are administered by subcutaneous injection, which is a method of injecting medication just under the skin.
