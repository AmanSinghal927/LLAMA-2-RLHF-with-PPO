This is because indomethacin selectively inhibits the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme that is responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which are pro-inflammatory mediators that can cause gastrointestinal damage. In contrast, piroxicam and phenylbutazone inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, which can lead to a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, which means it blocks the production of COX-2 enzyme specifically, thereby reducing the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding, making it a safer option for patients with a history of gastrointestinal risk.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 68-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient psychiatry clinic from the medical clinic.
