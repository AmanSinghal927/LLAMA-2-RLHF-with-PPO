In this type of lymphoma, the cancer cells form nodules that are surrounded by a fibrous tissue, which gives the nodules a characteristic \"sclerotic\" appearance.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because the term \"lymphocyte predominance\" is not a term that is used to describe the variety of Hodgkin's disease.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the lymphocytes are the predominant cell type in the tumor.\n\n"}, {"question": "Of all the pulpal sensibility test, which is best in a patient who is restored with Porcelain fused to metal crown?", "correct_answer": "Heat test", "options": ["A)Heat test", "B)EPT", "C)Pulse oximetery", "D)Cold test"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Of all the pulpal sensibility test, which is best in a patient who is restored with Porcelain fused to metal crown?A)Heat test B)EPT C)Pulse oximetery D)Cold test\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The heat test is the most reliable method for evaluating pulpal sensibility in a patient who has been restored with a Porcelain fused to metal (PFM) crown. This is because the PFM crown acts as a heat sink, dissipating heat away from the pulp, and the heat test is less likely to be affected by this. In contrast, the EPT and pulse oximetry may be less reliable in this situation because they are more sensitive to changes in pulpal blood flow, which may be affected by the PFM crown. The cold test is also less reliable in this situation because the PFM crown may conduct heat away from the pulp, making it difficult to assess pulpal sensibility.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because EPT is the most sensitive method for detecting pulpal sensibility in teeth with restorations, especially in cases of PFM crowns. The other methods may not be as accurate due to the presence of the crown.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because, pulse oximetry is the most accurate and reliable test for evaluating pulpal sensibility in a patient who has undergone restoration with a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown. The other tests, such as the heat test, EPT, and cold test, may not be as accurate or reliable in this situation.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because cold is a more sensitive stimulus than heat or EPT, and it is less likely to cause discomfort or pain in a patient with a PFM crown. Additionally, the cold test is more likely to detect pulpal sensibility in a tooth with a PFM crown, as the crown does not conduct heat as well as natural tooth structure.\n\n"}, {"question": "Hegar sign is seen in how many weeks ?", "correct_answer": "10-14 weeks", "options": ["A)6-10 weeks", "B)14-18 weeks", "C)18-22 weeks", "D)10-14 weeks"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Hegar sign is seen in how many weeks ?A)6-10 weeks B)14-18 weeks C)18-22 weeks D)10-14 weeks\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the Hegar sign is typically seen in the first trimester of pregnancy, between 6-10 weeks gestation.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the Hegar sign is typically visible on ultrasound between 14 and 18 weeks of pregnancy.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the Hegar sign is typically visible on ultrasound between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the Hegar sign is typically visible on ultrasound between 10-14 weeks of gestation.\n<human>"}, {"question": "Major adrenal androgen is ?", "correct_answer": "Coisol", "options": ["A)11-hydroxy derivative of androstenedione", "B)17-ketosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone", "C)Testosterone", "D)Coisol"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Major adrenal androgen is ?A)11-hydroxy derivative of androstenedione B)17-ketosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone C)Testosterone D)Coisol\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because 11-hydroxy derivative of androstenedione is the major adrenal androgen.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because 17-ketosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone is the major adrenal androgen.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because testosterone is the major adrenal androgen.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Coisol is the major adrenal androgen because it is the most abundant androgen produced in the adrenal gland.
