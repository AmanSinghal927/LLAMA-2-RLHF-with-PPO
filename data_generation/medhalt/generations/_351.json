Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status is 75%.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: That's because the carrier status of the disease is determined by the presence of a specific mutation in one copy of the gene. Since the woman's brother has the disease, it's likely that he inherited the mutated gene from one of their parents. Since the woman has no symptoms and is in good health, it's less likely that she inherited the mutated gene.
