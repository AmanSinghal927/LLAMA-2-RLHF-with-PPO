The increase in plasma concentration and excretion rate of substance observed in this patient is consistent with the administration of glucose.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Cystatin C is a protein that is produced by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Since the substance administered does not undergo tubular reabsorption, it is likely to be excreted in the urine without any significant change in its plasma concentration.

Para-aminohippurate is a substance that is not reabsorbed by the tubules and is therefore excreted directly into the urine. The excretion rate of this substance is directly proportional to the plasma concentration, as shown in the given data.
