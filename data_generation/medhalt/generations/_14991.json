In fact, they can even cause a paradoxical increase in calcium levels. This is because corticosteroids can increase the activity of osteoclasts, which are the cells responsible for bone resorption and the release of calcium into the bloodstream.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Fluoride is not effective in treating hypercalcemia.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Bisphosphonates are not effective in treating hypercalcemia caused by multiple myeloma.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Calcitonin is a hormone that inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone. In the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with multiple myeloma, calcitonin is not effective in reducing serum calcium levels.

D)33\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: When [2-2H] acetyl-CoA is added to the preparation, it will be converted to palmitate through the action of the enzymes and cofactors.

Since only 3 deuterium atoms are incorporated into each acetyl-CoA molecule, only 3 deuterium atoms will be incorporated into each palmitate molecule.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: When [2-2H] acetyl-CoA is added to the preparation, it is converted to palmitate through the action of the enzymes and cofactors. Since deuterium is added to the acetyl-CoA, it will be incorporated into each palmitate molecule. Since the excess of malonyl-CoA is not labeled, it will not be incorporated into the palmitate molecule. Therefore, each palmitate molecule will contain 33 deuterium atoms (2-2H from the acetyl-CoA and 32 from the palmitate).\n\n"}, {"question": "Location of visual coex?", "correct_answer": "Syln fissure", "options": ["A)Calcarine sulcus", "B)Precentral gyrus", "C)Postcentral gyrus", "D)Syln fissure"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Location of visual coex?A)Calcarine sulcus B)Precentral gyrus C)Postcentral gyrus D)Syln fissure\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The Calcarine sulcus is the area where the primary visual cortex is located, and it is the first point of processing for visual information.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The visual cortex is located in the precentral gyrus, which is the area of the brain responsible for processing visual information.
