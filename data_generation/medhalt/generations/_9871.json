The chest x-ray showing increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm supports this diagnosis. The initial pharmacotherapy of prednisone and albuterol is appropriate to treat the acute exacerbation and reduce inflammation. Tiotropium is not indicated in this scenario as it is a long-acting bronchodilator used for long-term management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Albuterol is a bronchodilator that is also used to treat bronchospasm, and it may be used in combination with theophylline to provide additional bronchodilation. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation, but it may not be effective in treating acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
