When the zygoma is fractured, the buttress region can help to stabilize the bone and reduce the risk of further displacement or depression of the fracture.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the intraorbital margin is the point of maximum reduction of the zygomatic malar complex (ZMC) fracture. The ZMC is a critical structure in the midface that provides stability and support to the orbit, and the intraorbital margin is the point where the ZMC meets the orbital rim. When the ZMC is fractured, the intraorbital margin is the point where the fracture is most likely to be reduced.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: The fronto-zygomatic suture region is a critical check point for ZMC fracture reduction because it provides a stable point of attachment for the fractured segments and helps to maintain the proper position and alignment of the bones during the reduction process. Additionally, the suture region is often the first point of contact between the fractured segments, making it an important landmark for guiding the reduction.\n\n"}, {"question": "11 yr female in the school brought to principle by teacher that she is always crying unattentive not taking interest in any activity.
