This is because the baby's head is engaged in the pelvis, which reduces the amount of space available for the amniotic fluid. As the baby grows and the head becomes more engaged, the amount of amniotic fluid decreases. Therefore, the maximum amniotic fluid volume occurs at 36 weeks.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: At 34 weeks, the maximum amniotic fluid level is typically reached, which is around 800-1000 ml.
