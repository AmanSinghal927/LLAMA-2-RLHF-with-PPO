This mutation leads to the production of defective collagen, which in turn causes the bones to be brittle and prone to fracture. The mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n", "output2": "\n\n", "output3": "\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder that affects the formation of collagen, a protein that gives strength and structure to bones.
