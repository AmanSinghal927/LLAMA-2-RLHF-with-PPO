This is because he will have one less chromosome 7 and one less chromosome 8, which will be replaced by an extra X chromosome.\n\n", "output1": "A male with monosomy of chromosome 7 and nulisomy of chromosome 8 will have 44 chromosomes (43 from the mother and one from the father). This is because the father's chromosome 8 is missing, so the child will have only one copy of chromosome 8, instead of the usual two copies. Therefore, the child will have 44 chromosomes instead of the usual 43.\n\n", "output2": "A male with monosomy of chromosome 7 and nulisomy of chromosome 8 will have 44 chromosomes. This is because the absence of chromosome 7 and the extra copy of chromosome 8 will compensate for each other, resulting in a total of 44 chromosomes.\n\n", "output3": "A male with monosomy of chromosome 7 and nulisomy of chromosome 8 will have 42 chromosomes instead of the typical 44 chromosomes found in most males. This is because the absence of one or more chromosomes can lead to a decrease in the total number of chromosomes.\n\n"}, {"question": "Among the complications that people who abuse alcohol present.
