The most common location for this spasm is in the distal part of the Right Coronary Artery, which is the location of the inferior wall of the heart. This can lead to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) in this area, which is why the Right Coronary Artery is the most commonly affected vessel.\n\n", "output1": "Coronary artery spasm most commonly occurs distal to atherosclerotic areas, which are areas of the coronary arteries that have been narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque. This can lead to a temporary reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, causing chest pain or discomfort, similar to a heart attack.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)No changes in ECG, Q wave become normal after few hours. Prinzmetal\u2019s angina is a type of variant angina that is characterized by episodes of chest pain without any evidence of coronary artery obstruction or wall motion abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG changes are typically reversible within a few hours.\n\n", "output3": "Prinzmetal\u2019s angina is a type of variant angina that is caused by coronary artery spasm. It is characterized by a sudden onset of chest pain that is often accompanied by ST segment elevation on an ECG. The pain is usually located in the inferior wall of the heart, but it can also occur in other locations. The ECG changes are similar to those seen in a myocardial infarction (heart attack), but the pain is not caused by a blockage in the coronary arteries. Instead, it is caused by a spasm of the coronary arteries, which can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress, cold weather, and certain medications.\n\n"}, {"question": "According to the transteoric model of the stages of change of Prochaska and Diclemente, when a person is aware that the tobacco habit is harmful to his health and he thinks about leaving it, but has not yet committed, we will say that he is in phase:", "correct_answer": "Contemplative", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Precontemplative", "B)Contemplative", "C)Preparatory", "D)Of action."], "prompt": "According to the transteoric model of the stages of change of Prochaska and Diclemente, when a person is aware that the tobacco habit is harmful to his health and he thinks about leaving it, but has not yet committed, we will say that he is in phase:A)Precontemplative\nB)Contemplative\nC)Preparatory\nD)Of action.", "subject_name": "nursery", "output0": "According to the transteoric model of the stages of change of Prochaska and Diclemente, when a person is aware that the tobacco habit is harmful to his health and he thinks about leaving it, but has not yet committed, we will say that he is in the precontemplative phase.
