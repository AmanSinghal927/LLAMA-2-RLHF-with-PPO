It is a type of pin that is inserted into the canal and has a self-tapping mechanism that helps to secure it in place. This type of pin is commonly used in the restoration of teeth that have undergone root canal treatment.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Cemented pin. A self-thread pin is not used in root canal treatment, as it is not necessary for the procedure. Cemented pins are used to hold the core in place, and they are made of a material that will not react with the root canal filling material.\n\n", "output2": "The frictional pin is the most commonly used type of pin in root canal treatment.
