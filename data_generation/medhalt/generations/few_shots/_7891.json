The patient's symptoms of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger are consistent with a bacterial infection, and cephalexin is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the patient's history of hunting and the presence of poison oak suggest that he may have been exposed to bacteria that can cause cellulitis.\n\n", "output2": "The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is smoking cessation.
