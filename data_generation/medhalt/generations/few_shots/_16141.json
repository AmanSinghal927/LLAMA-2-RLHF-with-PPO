This is because the extracellular space is the largest compartment of the body and contains the interstitial fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the cells.\n\n", "output1": "If the volume of distribution of a drug is less than 5 liters, it means that the drug is primarily distributed in the extracellular space. Therefore, the correct answer is Total body water.\n\n", "output2": "If the volume of distribution of a drug is <5L, it means that the drug is mostly confined to the vascular compartment, which is the blood and lymphatic fluid. This is because the drug is not distributed significantly into other body compartments, such as the extracellular space or intracellular space. Therefore, the drug is restricted to the vascular compartment.\n\n", "output3": "If the volume of distribution of a drug is less than 5L, it is likely to be restricted to the intracellular space. This is because the intracellular space is a smaller compartment than the extracellular space and total body water, and the drug is not likely to be distributed evenly throughout the body.\n\n"}, {"question": "Call Exner bodies seen in ?", "correct_answer": "Granulosa cell tumors", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Granulosa cell tumors", "B)Serous cystadenomas", "C)Dysgerminoma", "D)Krukenberg tumor"], "prompt": "Call Exner bodies seen in ?A)Granulosa cell tumors\nB)Serous cystadenomas\nC)Dysgerminoma\nD)Krukenberg tumor", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "Exner bodies are seen in granulosa cell tumors, which are rare tumors that develop in the ovaries.

CDKIs are negative regulators of the cell cycle, and they typically prevent the cell from entering mitosis until the appropriate time.
