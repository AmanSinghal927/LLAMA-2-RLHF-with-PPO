This is because Penicillin G is less likely to cause an allergic reaction than other forms of penicillin.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Sulfisoxazole because it is a sulfonamide antibiotic that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in someone with a history of penicillin allergy.\n\n", "output2": "Sulfasalazine is a sulfonamide antibacterial drug that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in someone with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity. While sulfonamides are related to penicillin, they are less likely to cross-react with the immune system, making them a safer choice for this individual.\n\n", "output3": "Streptomycin is a drug that is commonly used to treat rheumatic fever, and it is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in someone who has a history of penicillin hypersensitivity.\n\n"}, {"question": "A reaction in which a single raw material can produce two or more stereoisomeric products, but produces one of them in greater quantity than any other, is known as:", "correct_answer": "Stereoselective.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Enantiospecific.", "B)Stereoselective.", "C)Diastereospecific.", "D)Chiral."], "prompt": "A reaction in which a single raw material can produce two or more stereoisomeric products, but produces one of them in greater quantity than any other, is known as:A)Enantiospecific.\nB)Stereoselective.\nC)Diastereospecific.\nD)Chiral.", "subject_name": "chemistry", "output0": "Enantiospecific reactions are those in which a single raw material can produce two or more stereoisomeric products, but produces one of them in greater quantity than any other.
