Additionally, some mouthwashes contain ingredients that help to desensitize the teeth and reduce sensitivity.\n\n", "output1": "Using a desensitizing paste after removal of periodontal dressing can help to minimize sensitivity. This type of paste contains ingredients that help to block the dentinal tubules and reduce the transmission of sensation, thus minimizing discomfort.\n\n", "output2": "To keep sensitivity to the minimum after removing periodontal dressing, it is important to keep the roots and plaque free. This is because the exposed roots and plaque can cause sensitivity. Therefore, it is important to maintain good oral hygiene practices, such as brushing and flossing regularly, to keep the teeth and gums healthy and reduce sensitivity.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)None of the above because there is no effective way to keep sensitivity to the minimum after the removal of periodontal dressing.
