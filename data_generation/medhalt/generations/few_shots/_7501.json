However, it can also inhibit digestion and cause sweating.\n\n", "output1": "Sympathetic stimulation inhibits digestion by slowing down the movement of food through the digestive system and reducing the secretion of digestive enzymes. This is because the sympathetic nervous system is designed to prepare the body for \"fight or flight\" responses, and digestion is not a priority during these times.\n\n", "output2": "Sympathetic stimulation can inhibit the production and release of glucose, which can result in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is because the sympathetic nervous system can cause the release of hormones such as adrenaline, which can interfere with the normal functioning of the pancreas and cause a decrease in insulin production.\n\n", "output3": "Sympathetic stimulation inhibits the production and release of glucose.\n\n"}, {"question": "The following related neonatal transient tachypnea (transient tachypnea of \u200b\u200bnewborn) chest X-ray changes, what's wrong?", "correct_answer": "Abnormal chest X-ray images, often sustainable over four days", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Hilar infiltration increase", "B)Often can be seen minor fissure", "C)Abnormal chest X-ray images, often sustainable over four days", "D)Occasionally can be seen a small amount of pleural effusion"], "prompt": "The following related neonatal transient tachypnea (transient tachypnea of \u200b\u200bnewborn) chest X-ray changes, what's wrong?A)Hilar infiltration increase\nB)Often can be seen minor fissure\nC)Abnormal chest X-ray images, often sustainable over four days\nD)Occasionally can be seen a small amount of pleural effusion", "subject_name": null, "output0": "The hilar infiltration increase is the most common chest X-ray change seen in neonatal transient tachypnea. This is due to the fact that the hilar nodes are more sensitive to the inflammation caused by the infection.\n\n", "output1": "The minor fissure is a common chest X-ray finding in neonatal transient tachypnea. This is due to the immaturity of the lungs and the fact that the newborn's chest cavity is still developing.\n\n", "output2": "Transient tachypnea of newborn is a condition that occurs in some newborns, characterized by rapid breathing and abnormal chest X-ray images.

This is because the liver metabolizes the drug more quickly as the dose increases, resulting in a lower amount of drug available for absorption.\n\n", "output2": "The oral bioavailability of a drug may decrease with increasing dose if there are limitations in its solubility and dissolution speed. This is because the solubility of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract and the rate at which it dissolves can affect the amount of drug that is absorbed into the bloodstream. As the dose increases, the amount of drug that needs to be dissolved also increases, which can lead to a decrease in bioavailability.\n\n", "output3": "As the dose of a drug increases, its oral bioavailability may decrease due to limitations in its solubility and dissolution speed. This is because the drug may be more likely to precipitate out of solution as the dose increases, leading to reduced absorption.\n\n"}, {"question": "A middle-aged woman complained fingers will hemp, loss of sensation below the site allows physicians to confirm that the injured nerve is the ulnar nerve (ulnar nerve)?", "correct_answer": "The little finger of the palm (palmar surface of the 5th finger)", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Palm thumb (palmar surface of thumb)", "B)Ulnar palm of the forearm (ulnar side of the volar surface of forearm)", "C)The little finger of the palm (palmar surface of the 5th finger)", "D)Near the back of the tiger's mouth (dorsum of hand between the thumb and the 2nd finger)"], "prompt": "A middle-aged woman complained fingers will hemp, loss of sensation below the site allows physicians to confirm that the injured nerve is the ulnar nerve (ulnar nerve)?A)Palm thumb (palmar surface of thumb)\nB)Ulnar palm of the forearm (ulnar side of the volar surface of forearm)\nC)The little finger of the palm (palmar surface of the 5th finger)\nD)Near the back of the tiger's mouth (dorsum of hand between the thumb and the 2nd finger)", "subject_name": null, "output0": "The ulnar nerve can be compressed or injured at the wrist, and one of the most common locations for this to occur is at the palmar surface of the thumb.
