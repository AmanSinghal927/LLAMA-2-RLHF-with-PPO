This is done by turning the head to one side, which helps to keep the airway open and reduce the risk of further damage to the spine.\n\n", "output1": "In the case of cervical spine injury, the first step is to maintain the airway. This is because the neck is the most unstable part of the spine and the risk of respiratory or cardiac arrest is high. Therefore, the first priority is to ensure that the patient is breathing adequately and that their airway is secure.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Immobilization of spine. In the case of cervical spine injury, the first priority is to immobilize the spine to prevent further injury. This is because the cervical spine is particularly vulnerable to injury and can be easily damaged, leading to severe consequences such as paralysis or death.\n\n", "output3": "In the case of cervical spine injury, the first priority is to maintain the airway and stabilize the patient. The Turtle Technique is not indicated in this situation, as it is a technique used to help children regulate their emotions and behaviors, and is not related to the treatment of physical injuries.\n\n"}, {"question": "\u201cCandle Bone\u201d Disease is", "correct_answer": "Melorheostaosis", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Osteoporosis", "B)Osteopetrosis", "C)Melorheostaosis", "D)Poikilocytosis"], "prompt": "\u201cCandle Bone\u201d Disease isA)Osteoporosis\nB)Osteopetrosis\nC)Melorheostaosis\nD)Poikilocytosis", "subject_name": "Unknown", "output0": "\"Candle Bone\" Disease is a term used to describe osteoporosis in children.
