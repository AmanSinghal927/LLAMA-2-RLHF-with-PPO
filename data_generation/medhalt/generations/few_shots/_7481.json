When the patient's oxygen saturation is low, the heart is unable to pump enough oxygenated blood to the tissues, and the blood is shunted through the lungs, where it is not able to pick up enough oxygen. This results in low blood oxygen levels, as seen in the patient's arterial blood gas analysis.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's arterial blood gas analysis results showed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) was low, indicating that the patient had low blood oxygen levels. This is due to the fact that the patient had a history of clubbing and cyanosis of the extremities, which suggests that the patient had a pulmonary diffusion barrier that was preventing the oxygen from being absorbed into the bloodstream. The administration of pure oxygen for 30 minutes, however, helped to increase the PaO2 levels and improve the patient's oxygenation.\n\n"}, {"question": "What is the dose of adrenaline in anaphylactic shock?", "correct_answer": "0.5 ml in 1:1000", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)0.5 ml in 1:1000", "B)0.5 ml in 1:10000", "C)1 ml in 1:1000", "D)1.5 ml in 1:1000"], "prompt": "What is the dose of adrenaline in anaphylactic shock?A)0.5 ml in 1:1000\nB)0.5 ml in 1:10000\nC)1 ml in 1:1000\nD)1.5 ml in 1:1000", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "The correct dose of adrenaline for anaphylactic shock is 0.5 ml in 1:1000.
