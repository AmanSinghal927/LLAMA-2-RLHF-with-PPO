A pulpal floor depth of 1mm is considered a critical factor in determining the resistance of the isthmus to fracture. A deeper pulpal floor is associated with increased stress concentrations, which can lead to fracture.\n\n", "output1": "The presence of a dove tail, which is a small triangular or wedge-shaped groove on the occlusal surface of the tooth, helps to increase the resistance of the amalgam to fracture. This is because the dove tail helps to distribute the forces of mastication more evenly across the tooth, reducing the likelihood of stress concentrations that could lead to fracture.\n\n", "output2": "The axiopulpal line angle is the angle formed by the axial surface of the tooth and the pulpal floor. A rounded axiopulpal line angle is less likely to fracture than a sharp angle, as it reduces the potential for crack propagation.
