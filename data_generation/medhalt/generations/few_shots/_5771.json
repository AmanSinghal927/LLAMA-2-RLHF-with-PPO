When the body is under starvation conditions, the liver converts stored fat into glucose and ketones, which are then used as energy sources. Acetyl CoA Carboxylase is activated during this process to help synthesize fatty acids from acetyl CoA.\n\n", "output1": "Acetyl CoA Carboxylase is stimulated by glucagon, which is a hormone produced by the pancreas. Glucagon stimulates the conversion of acetyl-CoA into fatty acids, which can then be used as energy.\n\n", "output2": "Acetyl CoA Carboxylase is stimulated by citrate. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, and citrate inhibits the activity of this enzyme.\n\n", "output3": "Acetyl CoA Carboxylase is stimulated by multiple factors, including starvation, glucagon, and citrate.

The dissociation curve of O2 is hyperbolic, meaning that the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen increases as the partial pressure of oxygen decreases. This is important because it allows hemoglobin to release oxygen to tissues even at very low partial pressures of oxygen.\n\n", "output1": "The intracellular pH does not affect the binding of O2 to hemoglobin because the binding site for O2 is located in the alpha subunit of hemoglobin, which is a highly acidic environment. This means that the pH inside the red blood cell does not significantly affect the binding of O2 to hemoglobin.\n\n", "output2": "2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (2,3BPG) is a molecule that is present in red blood cells and plays a critical role in the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. When 2,3BPG is present, it reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, making it easier for oxygen to bind to the protein.\n\n", "output3": "Hemoglobin S is the form of hemoglobin that is present in the Caucasian race. It is characterized by a single amino acid substitution at position 6 of the beta-globin chain, which results in a difference in the binding of oxygen compared to other forms of hemoglobin.\n\n"}, {"question": "Fair bank\u2019s triangle is seen in?", "correct_answer": "Coxa vara", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Tibia vara", "B)Genu valgum", "C)Hip fracture", "D)Coxa vara"], "prompt": "Fair bank\u2019s triangle is seen in?A)Tibia vara\nB)Genu valgum\nC)Hip fracture\nD)Coxa vara", "subject_name": "Unknown", "output0": "Fair bank\u2019s triangle is seen in Tibia vara, which is a condition characterized by an abnormal positioning of the tibia bone in the lower leg.

However, it can also cause ocular hypotension with apnea, which is a condition where the infant's eye pressure drops too low, leading to a decrease in blood flow to the eye and a temporary loss of consciousness. This is a rare side effect, but it can be dangerous, so it's important to monitor the infant closely if this medication is prescribed.\n\n", "output2": "Brimonidine is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist that can cause ocular hypotension with apnea in infants.
