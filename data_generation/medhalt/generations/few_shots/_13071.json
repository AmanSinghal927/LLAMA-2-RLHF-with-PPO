The prepuce is a sensitive area and is more prone to infection and cancer.\n\n", "output2": "The most common site of penile carcinoma is the shaft of the penis, accounting for approximately 80% of cases. This is due to the fact that the shaft is the most exposed part of the penis and is more susceptible to environmental factors such as UV radiation and bacterial infections.\n\n", "output3": "The coronal sulcus is the area of the penis where the skin is most thin and delicate, making it more susceptible to carcinoma. Therefore, the most common site of penile carcinoma is the coronal sulcus.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy.
