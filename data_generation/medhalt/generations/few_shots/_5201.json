A ratio of 1.5 or higher indicates that the lungs are mature and ready for birth.\n\n", "output1": "The billirubin content of amniotic fluid is the most reliable method for assessing foetal lung maturity. Billirubin is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells in the foetus, and its presence in the amniotic fluid is a sign that the foetus is producing enough red blood cells and that the lungs are mature enough to handle the increased oxygenation of the blood.\n\n", "output2": "Foetal lung maturity can be assessed using ultrasound by measuring the size and development of the foetal lung. The L/S ratio (Lung-to-Head ratio) is also used to assess foetal lung maturity, but it is not the only way to do so.\n\n", "output3": "Amniocentesis is the most accurate method for assessing foetal lung maturity.

Additionally, it inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline, which can contribute to its analgesic effect.\n\n", "output1": "Tramadol, in addition to stimulating mu opioid receptors, also has anticholinergic properties. This means that it blocks the activity of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the transmission of pain signals. By blocking acetylcholine, tramadol can help to reduce the sensation of pain.\n\n", "output2": "Tramadol, in addition to acting on mu opioid receptors, also has an antihistaminic effect. This means that it can help to relieve symptoms of allergies, such as itching and sneezing.\n\n", "output3": "Tramadol, in addition to acting on mu opioid receptors, also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine, which contributes to its analgesic and euphoric effects.

It is linked to the X chromosome and has a recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n", "output2": "Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce a certain enzyme, leading to a range of symptoms including pain, muscle weakness, and kidney problems. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which means that the condition is more common in males than in females. Females can be carriers of the condition and may exhibit mild symptoms.\n\n", "output3": "Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects girls almost exclusively. It is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Since females have two X chromosomes, they are more likely to inherit the mutated gene and develop the condition. Recessive inheritance linked to the X chromosome means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition.\n\n"}, {"question": "8th and 9th rib costal cailage forms which type of joint?", "correct_answer": "Synol joint", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Costochondral joint", "B)Interchondral joint", "C)Synol joint", "D)Costoveebral joint"], "prompt": "8th and 9th rib costal cailage forms which type of joint?A)Costochondral joint\nB)Interchondral joint\nC)Synol joint\nD)Costoveebral joint", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "The 8th and 9th rib costal cartilage forms a costochondral joint, which is a type of synovial joint that connects the ribs to the sternum.\n\n", "output1": "The 8th and 9th rib costal cartilages form interchondral joints.
