In fact, gastric lavage may be contraindicated after ingestion of other acids, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and carbolic acid (phenol), because these acids can cause more severe damage to the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n", "output1": "Gastric lavage is contraindicated after ingestion of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) because it can cause further damage to the stomach and intestines. Instead, the focus should be on supportive care and managing symptoms until the acid has passed through the digestive system.\n\n", "output2": "Gastric lavage is not contraindicated after ingestion of carbolic acid because it is a weak acid and does not cause significant damage to the gastrointestinal tract.
