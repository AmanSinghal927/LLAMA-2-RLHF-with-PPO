The phrenic nerve is responsible for the diaphragm's movement, and it is not involved in the quiet inspiration process.\n\n", "output1": "During the calm suction (quiet inspiration) process, the internal intercostal muscles do not contract. This is because the diaphragm is the primary muscle used for inspiration during this technique. The internal intercostal muscles are used for expiration, and their contraction would interfere with the diaphragm's ability to function effectively.\n\n", "output2": "During the Turtle Technique, the lungs are not compressed, so the internal pressure of the pleura (intrapleural pressure) does not decrease.

In fact, if the reinforcers are too intense, they can actually slow down the extinction process.\n\n", "output2": "The extinction procedure is slower when the response to be eliminated requires less effort, as it is less likely to be extinguished.
