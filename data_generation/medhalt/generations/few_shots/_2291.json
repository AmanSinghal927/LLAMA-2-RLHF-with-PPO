[{"question": "The carat for Au foil used for restorations is:", "correct_answer": "24", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)18", "B)20", "C)22", "D)24"], "prompt": "The carat for Au foil used for restorations is:A)18\nB)20\nC)22\nD)24", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "The carat for Au foil used for restorations is typically 18. This is because 18-carat gold is considered to be the optimal thickness for restorations, as it is strong enough to withstand the forces of biting and chewing, yet still relatively flexible and biocompatible.\n\n", "output1": "The carat for Au foil used for restorations is typically 20. This is because 20 carat gold is a common standard for dental restorations, and it provides a good balance between strength, durability, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n", "output2": "The carat for Au foil used for restorations is 22. This is because 22 carat gold is the standard for dental restorations, as it is strong enough to withstand the forces of biting and chewing, while also being relatively soft and easy to shape and mold.\n\n", "output3": "The carat for Au foil used for restorations is typically 24. This is because 24 carat gold is more durable and less prone to wear and tear than lower carat gold. Additionally, 24 carat gold is more expensive, which can be an advantage when creating restorations that need to be long-lasting.\n\n"}, {"question": "A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women.

Which process caused this change?A)Hyperplasia\nB)Hypertrophy\nC)Atrophy\nD)Metaplasia", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Hyperplasia is the process of increased cell division and growth, which can occur in response to a variety of stimuli, including hormonal changes during pregnancy. This is the most likely explanation for the increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation in the breast tissue of pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women.\n\n", "output1": "The increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation in pregnant women is due to the process of hypertrophy, which is the enlargement of existing tissue. This is a common response to pregnancy, as the body prepares for lactation and the increased demands of breastfeeding.\n\n", "output2": "Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells, while hypertrophy is an increase in the size of cells. Atrophy is a decrease in the size of cells, and metaplasia is a change in the type of cells. In this case, the increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation in pregnant women is due to atrophy of the breast tissue.\n\n", "output3": "The increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation in pregnant women is caused by metaplasia, which is the process of one type of tissue being replaced by another. In this case, the pregnant women's breast tissue is replacing the acinar glands with epithelial proliferation, leading to an increase in the number of acinar glands.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is least likely to cause loss of sense of smell?", "correct_answer": "Nasopharyngeal cyst", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Septal deviation", "B)Nasopharyngeal cyst", "C)Frontal lobe tumor", "D)Viral infection"], "prompt": "Which of the following is least likely to cause loss of sense of smell?A)Septal deviation\nB)Nasopharyngeal cyst\nC)Frontal lobe tumor\nD)Viral infection", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Septal deviation is the least likely cause of loss of sense of smell. This is because the septum is a structure in the nose that separates the two sides of the nasal passages and helps to direct airflow. While a septal deviation can cause some difficulty with breathing, it is not typically associated with a loss of sense of smell.\n\n", "output1": "Nasopharyngeal cysts are typically benign and are not known to cause loss of sense of smell. The other options, such as septal deviation, frontal lobe tumor, and viral infections, can all potentially cause loss of sense of smell.\n\n", "output2": "A frontal lobe tumor is the least likely cause of loss of sense of smell, as it is a type of brain tumor that does not typically affect the olfactory system. In contrast, septal deviation, nasopharyngeal cyst, and viral infections can all cause loss of sense of smell.\n\n", "output3": "Viral infections are the least likely cause of loss of sense of smell, as they do not directly affect the olfactory system. The other options, such as septal deviation, nasopharyngeal cyst, and frontal lobe tumor, can all potentially cause loss of sense of smell by affecting the olfactory nerve or the brain's ability to process olfactory information.\n\n"}, {"question": "WHO normal Hb value for a non pregnant adult female is ?", "correct_answer": "12 gm/dl", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)10 gm/di", "B)11 gm /dl", "C)12 gm/dl", "D)13 gm/dl"], "prompt": "WHO normal Hb value for a non pregnant adult female is ?A)10 gm/di\nB)11 gm /dl\nC)12 gm/dl\nD)13 gm/dl", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The normal hemoglobin (Hb) value for a non-pregnant adult female is 10-12 gm/dl. Therefore, the correct answer is A)10 gm/di.\n\n", "output1": "The normal hemoglobin (Hb) value for a non-pregnant adult female is between 11 and 13 grams per deciliter (g/dl). This range takes into account the normal variation in Hb levels and the fact that some individuals may have a slightly lower or higher Hb level due to various factors such as age, genetics, and nutritional status.\n\n", "output2": "The normal hemoglobin (Hb) value for a non-pregnant adult female is around 12 gm/dl. This is the average value for healthy adult women, but it can vary depending on factors such as age, genetics, and overall health.\n\n", "output3": "The normal hemoglobin (Hb) value for a non-pregnant adult female is 13 g/dL.
