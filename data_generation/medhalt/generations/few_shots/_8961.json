It can be a physical response to a perceived threat, and it can also be a sign of anxiety and fear.\n\n", "output1": "Palpitations are a common symptom of panic attacks, and they are often accompanied by other symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and a feeling of impending doom. The Turtle Technique can help children in this age group to better manage their panic attacks and reduce their symptoms.\n\n", "output2": "Panic attacks are characterized by a feeling of intense fear or anxiety that is often accompanied by physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, and trembling. However, the most common symptom of panic attacks is the fear of going crazy or losing control.\n\n", "output3": "The feeling of unreality is a common symptom of panic attacks. This can be caused by the intense physical and emotional sensations that occur during a panic attack, which can make the person feel as though they are losing control or going crazy.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following non-common cause of emergency room patients with schizophrenia to?", "correct_answer": "insomnia", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Fails to take medication", "B)Side effects of medication", "C)Suicide", "D)insomnia"], "prompt": "Which of the following non-common cause of emergency room patients with schizophrenia to?A)Fails to take medication\nB)Side effects of medication\nC)Suicide\nD)insomnia", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Patients with schizophrenia who fail to take their medication as prescribed are at a higher risk of experiencing an acute psychotic episode, which can lead to emergency room visits.\n\n", "output1": "Side effects of medication are a common cause of emergency room visits for patients with schizophrenia.

MAPK is a key signaling pathway involved in glucose metabolism and is activated by glucagon. By inhibiting the activity of the glucagon receptor, the drug reduces the activation of MAPK, leading to decreased glucose production in the liver and increased insulin sensitivity.\n\n", "output1": "Guanylate cyclase is an enzyme that plays a key role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Treatment with a glucagon receptor antagonist, such as the drug being studied in the clinical trial, would be expected to decrease the activity of guanylate cyclase, leading to decreased glucose production in the liver and increased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. This would result in lowered serum glucose levels.\n\n", "output2": "The glucagon receptor antagonist is a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. PKA is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. By inhibiting PKA, the drug reduces the activity of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, leading to lower serum glucose levels.
