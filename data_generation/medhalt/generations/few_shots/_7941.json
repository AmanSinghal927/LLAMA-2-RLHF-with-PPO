This is because the middle third of the root is the strongest and most vital part of the tooth, and therefore is more likely to heal and maintain its integrity.\n\n", "output2": "The best prognosis for root fractures is with apical third fractures because the apical third of the tooth is the most vital part of the tooth, and it is less likely to be affected by the fracture. Additionally, the apical third is the most accessible part of the tooth for treatment, making it easier to perform the necessary procedures.\n\n", "output3": "The best prognosis for root fractures is when the fracture occurs between the middle and coronal third. This is because the fracture is less likely to extend into the apical third, which has a higher risk of complications.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks.
