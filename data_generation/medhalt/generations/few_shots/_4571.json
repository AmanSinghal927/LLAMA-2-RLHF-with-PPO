This is because CYP2D6 is responsible for the metabolism of codeine into morphine, and slow metabolizers may not convert codeine as efficiently, resulting in lower levels of morphine and potentially reduced analgesic efficacy.", "output1": "In slow metabolizing CYP2D6 patients, one would expect to find inefficacy of the treatment with acenocoumarol, as the drug is not metabolized properly, leading to reduced efficacy.\n\n", "output2": "When codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6, it is converted into morphine, which is then converted into morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). M6G is a potent analgesic that has a synergistic effect with paracetamol. Therefore, in slow metabolizing CYP2D6 patients, the potentiation of the synergistic effect of codeine with paracetamol is expected.\n\n", "output3": "In patients with slow metabolizing CYP2D6, the analgesic efficacy of codeine may be reduced. This is because codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6, and if the enzyme is slow, the drug will be metabolized more slowly, leading to lower concentrations of the active metabolite. As a result, a higher dose of amitriptyline may be required to achieve the same therapeutic effect.\n\n"}, {"question": "Clinical signs and symptoms of tetanus are as a result of:", "correct_answer": "Exotoxin fixed to motor nerve end plate", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Endotoxin", "B)Exotoxin fixed to motor nerve end plate", "C)Circulating exotoxins", "D)Both endotoxins and exotoxins"], "prompt": "Clinical signs and symptoms of tetanus are as a result of:A)Endotoxin\nB)Exotoxin fixed to motor nerve end plate\nC)Circulating exotoxins\nD)Both endotoxins and exotoxins", "subject_name": "Medicine", "output0": "Clinical signs and symptoms of tetanus are caused by the presence of endotoxins in the body.
