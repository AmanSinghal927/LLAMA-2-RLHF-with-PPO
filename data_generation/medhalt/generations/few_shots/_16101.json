Its absence leads to iron overload, as there is no regulation of iron absorption in the body.\n\n", "output1": "Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron absorption in the body.

It regulates the absorption of iron from the diet and the recycling of iron from old red blood cells. The absence of hepcidin leads to iron overload, while an excess of hepcidin can cause iron deficiency. Therefore, option A is incorrect, as hepcidin is not directly involved in iron overload.
