Radiation exposure to the GIT can cause some damage to the cells lining the tract, but the effects are generally limited and reversible.\n\n", "output1": "Cartilage is the least affected by radiation. This is because it is a connective tissue that does not have a high metabolic rate or rapid cell turnover, which makes it less susceptible to the harmful effects of radiation.\n\n", "output2": "Gonads, such as ovaries and testes, are the least affected by radiation. Radiation can damage the DNA in these organs, but the effects are usually temporary and reversible. The GI tract (Option A) and lymphocytes (Option D) are more susceptible to the effects of radiation.\n\n", "output3": "Lymphocytes are the least affected by radiation because they are the most mobile and can move away from the radiation source more easily than other cells in the body. This means that they are less likely to be damaged by radiation.\n\n"}, {"question": "About attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) narrative of the following is correct?", "correct_answer": "Good therapeutic effect of stimulant drugs", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Good therapeutic effect of stimulant drugs", "B)Just sit in the classroom, it can be said that suffer from this disease", "C)All symptoms will disappear completely into the teens", "D)Only through neuropsychological tests to confirm the diagnosis"], "prompt": "About attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) narrative of the following is correct?A)Good therapeutic effect of stimulant drugs\nB)Just sit in the classroom, it can be said that suffer from this disease\nC)All symptoms will disappear completely into the teens\nD)Only through neuropsychological tests to confirm the diagnosis", "subject_name": null, "output0": "The correct answer is A) Good therapeutic effect of stimulant drugs. Stimulant drugs, such as Ritalin, have been shown to have a good therapeutic effect in treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These drugs can help improve attention, concentration, and impulse control in children with ADHD.\n\n", "output1": "The statement \"Just sit in the classroom, it can be said that suffer from this disease\" is correct because Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often associated with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. However, it is not accurate to say that individuals with ADHD will simply \"sit in the classroom\" and not experience any other symptoms. In fact, ADHD can have a significant impact on an individual's academic performance, social relationships, and overall quality of life.\n\n", "output2": "It is a common misconception that children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) will outgrow the disorder as they enter their teenage years. However, this is not always the case. Many individuals with ADHD continue to experience symptoms throughout their lives, and the disorder can persist into adulthood.\n\n", "output3": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects both children and adults. While stimulant drugs can be effective in reducing symptoms, they are not a diagnostic tool. Additionally, the symptoms of ADHD do not disappear completely in adolescence, and a thorough neuropsychological evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n"}, {"question": "What germ cell tumors (germ cell tumor) response to radiation treatment and the best possible cure?", "correct_answer": "Germ cell tumor (germinoma)", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Choriocarcinoma (choriocarcinoma)", "B)Embryonal carcinoma (embryonal carcinoma)", "C)Germ cell tumor (germinoma)", "D)Endodermal sinus tumor (endodermal sinus tumor)"], "prompt": "What germ cell tumors (germ cell tumor) response to radiation treatment and the best possible cure?A)Choriocarcinoma (choriocarcinoma)\nB)Embryonal carcinoma (embryonal carcinoma)\nC)Germ cell tumor (germinoma)\nD)Endodermal sinus tumor (endodermal sinus tumor)", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Choriocarcinoma is a type of germ cell tumor that is highly responsive to radiation treatment.
