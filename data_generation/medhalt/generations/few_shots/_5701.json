This is because cohort studies involve following a group of individuals over time, which allows researchers to observe the effects of an intervention or exposure on the individuals in the study.\n\n", "output2": "The Hawthorne effect is often seen in cross-sectional studies, as it is a type of bias that occurs when participants in a study are aware that they are being observed or measured. This can lead to changes in their behavior, and therefore, the results of the study may not be representative of the population being studied.\n\n", "output3": "The Hawthorne effect is seen in retrospective cohort studies. This is because retrospective cohort studies are designed to look back in time and identify potential causes of an outcome, rather than prospectively following a group of participants over time.
