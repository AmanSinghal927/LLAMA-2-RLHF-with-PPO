This means that each lymphocyte has a unique receptor that is specific to a particular antigen, and the offspring of that lymphocyte will also have the same receptor and specificity.\n\n", "output1": "The receptors for the lymphocyte antigen are called clonotypic because each lymphocyte and its offspring (clone) express a unique type of them with several antigenic specificities. This means that each lymphocyte has a specific receptor that recognizes a specific antigen, and the receptor is expressed in a unique way on each lymphocyte.\n\n", "output2": "The receptors for the lymphocyte antigen are called clonotypic because they are expressed by several lymphocytes and their offspring (clones) with different antigenic specificities. This means that each lymphocyte and its offspring can recognize and respond to different antigens, which is important for the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to a wide range of pathogens.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)After molecular cloning and gene rearrangement, the lymphocytes acquire clonal antigenic specificity. This is because the lymphocytes undergo a process called clonal selection, in which the cells that have the highest affinity for the antigen are selected to survive and reproduce, while the others are eliminated. This process leads to the development of a single clone of cells that are all specific for a single antigen.\n\n"}, {"question": "In pregnancy, the most common cause of transient- diabetes insipidus is:", "correct_answer": "Severe preeclampsia", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Severe preeclampsia", "B)Hydramnios", "C)Multiple pregnancy", "D)IUGR"], "prompt": "In pregnancy, the most common cause of transient- diabetes insipidus is:A)Severe preeclampsia\nB)Hydramnios\nC)Multiple pregnancy\nD)IUGR", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "Severe preeclampsia is a condition that can occur during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs such as the kidneys and liver.

This activates the Ras protein, which then activates the MAPKKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) pathway.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B because it is the next step in the signaling pathway after Ras is activated. Activated Ras recruits and activates MAPKKK, which then phosphorylates and activates MAPKK and MAPK, leading to the activation of transcription factors and the regulation of cell division gene expression.\n\n", "output2": "Because the correct statement is that the phosphorylated MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) is activated and can phosphorylate a number of transcription factors, which can then activate the regulation of cell division gene expression.
