This is the most correct statement about mature B cells.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is that mature B cells have been bound to antigen. This is because mature B cells are responsible for producing antibodies that are specific to particular antigens, and they can only do this if they have first been bound to the antigen.\n\n", "output2": "Memory B cells are present in the thymus in number of at most.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Memory B cells to produce antibodies of high affinity the more generally. Memory B cells are a type of B cell that has already encountered an antigen and has undergone clonal expansion and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. These cells are present in the body for long periods of time and can quickly produce large amounts of antibodies with high affinity for a specific antigen if they are exposed to it again.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 38-year-old woman, no significant past medical history, to weight loss clinic requirements.

Given the patient's family history of diabetes, it would be appropriate to consider metformin as a possible treatment option.

This is because the waist circumference of 88 cm is greater than 80 cm, indicating central obesity.

Therefore, liposuction of abdominal fat would be an appropriate intervention for this patient.\n\n", "output3": "The best approach for weight loss in this patient is to start with diet and exercise. The use of weight loss drugs, such as sibutramine or orlistat, should be avoided in patients with hypertension, as these drugs can increase blood pressure and can be harmful.

This is because the bacteria can only cause damage to the tooth if the host's immune system is weakened or compromised.\n\n", "output1": "The rapid progression of bacteria resulting in pulpal necrosis is primarily due to the virulence of the bacteria. The virulence of bacteria refers to their ability to cause disease in a host. In the case of pulpal necrosis, the bacteria are able to produce toxins and enzymes that are harmful to the pulp and can cause rapid tissue destruction.\n\n", "output2": "The rapid progression of bacteria resulting in pulpal necrosis is primarily due to the dentinal fluid flow.
