The low T4 and T3 levels on serum analysis confirm this diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's high TSH level is the most helpful finding in the diagnosis. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones.
