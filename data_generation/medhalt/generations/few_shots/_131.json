The presence of pitting edema in the lower limbs, along with the patient's age and the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors, suggest that the edema is likely due to nephrotic syndrome. Serum albumin is an important diagnostic marker for nephrotic syndrome, and a low level of serum albumin would support this diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of edema in the lower limbs, especially the pitting edema, suggest a possible liver dysfunction.

The normal jugular venous pressure and heart size, as well as the absence of a heart murmur, indicate that the heart failure is not due to a mechanical problem. The liver function tests (ALT, AST) are not relevant to this case. The BUN and creatinine are waste products that are elevated in heart failure, but the patient's normal jugular venous pressure suggests that the heart failure is not severe. The ejection fraction, which is a measure of the heart's pumping ability, can be measured using Nuclear Medicine injection, and would be useful in determining the severity of the heart failure.\n\n"}, {"question": "objectives of periodontal plastic surgery are", "correct_answer": "All of the above", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Problems associated with attached gingiva", "B)Problems associated with a shallow vestibule", "C)Problems associated with an aberrant frenum", "D)All of the above"], "prompt": "objectives of periodontal plastic surgery areA)Problems associated with attached gingiva\nB)Problems associated with a shallow vestibule\nC)Problems associated with an aberrant frenum\nD)All of the above", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Periodontal plastic surgery aims to correct problems associated with attached gingiva, such as excessive gingival display, gum recession, and pocket formation.\n\n", "output1": "Periodontal plastic surgery is used to treat problems associated with a shallow vestibule, such as difficulty with oral hygiene and an increased risk of periodontal disease.
