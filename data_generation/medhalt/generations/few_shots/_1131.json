These cofactors are essential for the enzyme to function properly and to facilitate the binding of the substrate.\n\n", "output2": "Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. When an enzyme catalyzes a certain reaction, it is not modified or denatured. Instead, it can be reused multiple times without losing its catalytic activity.
