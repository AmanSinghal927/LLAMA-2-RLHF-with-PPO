At this age, there is no need to undergo any tests to determine the risk of having another child with Down syndrome. Additionally, since the mother is above the age of 35, there is already a higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome naturally.\n\n", "output1": "Ultra sound at 17 weeks of pregnancy can provide a good indication of the risk of Down syndrome. However, it is important to note that a definitive diagnosis of Down syndrome cannot be made until after birth.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Amniotic fluid samples plus chromosomal analysis will definitely tell her that next baby will be down syndromic or not. This is because amniocentesis is a diagnostic test that can detect chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, in the fetus. The test involves the collection of amniotic fluid from the uterus and then analyzing the fluid for chromosomal abnormalities.\n\n", "output3": "Blood screening is the best option for the mother at this point in time, as it can detect the risk of Down syndrome with a high degree of accuracy. However, it is important to note that blood screening is not 100% accurate and cannot definitively diagnose Down syndrome.\n\n"}, {"question": "Endontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture than untreated one because:", "correct_answer": "Loss of coronal structure.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Loss of moisture.", "B)Hollow canals.", "C)Loss of coronal structure.", "D)All of the above."], "prompt": "Endontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture than untreated one because:A)Loss of moisture.\nB)Hollow canals.\nC)Loss of coronal structure.\nD)All of the above.", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Endontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture because the removal of the pulp and the filling materials can create a loss of moisture in the tooth, which can lead to a decrease in the tooth's strength and flexibility.\n\n", "output1": "Endontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture because they have hollow canals, which can lead to a loss of structural integrity and a higher risk of fracture.\n\n", "output2": "Endontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture because the removal of the pulp and the subsequent loss of the coronal structure can lead to a weakening of the tooth.
