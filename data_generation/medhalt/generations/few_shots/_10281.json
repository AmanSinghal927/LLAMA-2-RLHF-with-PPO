The pulsatile nature of the tinnitus is due to the fact that the tumour is located near the blood vessels of the middle ear, and it causes the blood vessels to pulsate, leading to a pulsating sound in the ear.\n\n", "output1": "Pulsatile tinnitus is a feature of acoustic neuroma, which is a type of non-cancerous tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain.

This is because the dental stone is a type of gypsum product, and gypsum is hygroscopic, meaning that it absorbs water. When the stone is stored at a high temperature, the water within the stone can evaporate, causing the stone to dry out and crack.\n\n", "output1": "When dental stone is exposed to high temperatures, the dihydrate in the stone will change to hemihydrate, causing the stone to contract. This can result in cracking or breaking of the stone.\n\n", "output2": "When dental stone is exposed to high temperatures, such as those above 90\u00b0C, it can undergo a process called \"thermal shock,\" which can cause it to crack or shatter. This is because the stone is made up of a mixture of water and a powdered mineral, and the water can evaporate quickly at high temperatures, causing the stone to contract and potentially crack. However, if the stone is set and fully hardened, it will not be affected by thermal shock and will not change.\n\n", "output3": "When dental stone is exposed to high temperatures (>90\u00b0C), the alpha hemihydrate in the stone will convert to beta hemihydrate.
