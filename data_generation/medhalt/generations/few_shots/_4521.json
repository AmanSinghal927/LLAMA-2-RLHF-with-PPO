A lower modifier content results in a higher eluent strength, as the organic modifier is the weaker component.\n\n", "output1": "This is because the eluent strength of a mobile phase is determined by the ability of the solvent to dissolve the solute and carry it through the column. If a solute has a lower retention factor in a particular mobile phase, it means that it is more easily dissolved and carried through the column by that solvent. Therefore, a solvent with a lower retention factor will have a greater eluent strength than a solvent with a higher retention factor.\n\n", "output2": "Eluents are classified as strong or weak based on their eluent strength, which is a measure of the ability of the mobile phase to dissolve and separate the analytes in the column.

The organic modifier is a weak solvent compared to water, which means that it will have a lower eluent strength. This is because the organic modifier will have a lower affinity for the analytes being separated, resulting in a lower retention factor for the analytes.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 75-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month.
