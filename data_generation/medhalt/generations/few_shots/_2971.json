This is because the bacteria that cause tooth decay thrive in a warm, moist environment, which is often found in the mouth. By controlling the temperature, dentists can help prevent the growth of these bacteria and reduce the risk of tooth decay.\n\n", "output1": "The fourth factor in the Caries Tetralogy, as proposed by Newburn, is time. This factor refers to the length of time that the tooth is exposed to the caries-causing bacteria and the sugars that they feed on. The longer the exposure, the greater the risk of developing dental caries.\n\n", "output2": "The fourth factor in the Caries Tetralogy by Newburn is Frequency. This refers to the number of times a child consumes sugary drinks or snacks throughout the day. The more frequently a child consumes these types of foods, the higher their risk of developing dental caries.\n\n", "output3": "The fourth factor in Caries tetralogy by Newburn is Substrate, which refers to the type of material that the bacteria use to produce acid.
