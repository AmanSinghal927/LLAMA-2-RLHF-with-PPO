The type of alloy and the noble metal and base metal ratio are important factors, but the design of the restoration plays a more critical role in determining the likelihood of fracture.\n\n", "output1": "The type of alloy used for gold restoration is a critical factor in determining the fracture resistance of the restoration. Different types of gold alloys have varying levels of strength and durability, and the choice of alloy can significantly impact the longevity of the restoration.\n\n", "output2": "The fracture of gold restoration primarily depends on the noble metal and base metal ratio. This is because the noble metal (usually gold) is more prone to fracture than the base metal (usually silver or base metals), and the ratio of these metals in the alloy affects the overall strength of the restoration.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)All of above because the fracture of gold restoration depends on a combination of factors, including the design of the restoration, the type of alloy used, and the ratio of noble metal to base metal.\n\n"}, {"question": "Impression compound base:", "correct_answer": "Low thermal conductivity", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Low thermal conductivity", "B)Crystalline structure", "C)Formation of cross linkage with heating", "D)High fusion temperature"], "prompt": "Impression compound base:A)Low thermal conductivity\nB)Crystalline structure\nC)Formation of cross linkage with heating\nD)High fusion temperature", "subject_name": "Dental"}, {"question": "A 56-year-old man comes to the emergency department for chest pain that started 1 hour ago.
