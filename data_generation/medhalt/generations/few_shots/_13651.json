This fusion causes the foramen ovale, a small opening in the heart that allows blood to flow between the right and left sides, to close.\n\n", "output1": "The septum secundum and the endocardial cushion are the two structures that fuse to form the fossa ovalis. This fusion is important for the proper development of the heart and the closure of the fossa ovalis.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Septum primum + Septum secundum. This is because the septum primum and septum secundum fuse to form the fossa ovalis, which is a depression in the atrial septum.\n\n", "output3": "The Fossa ovalis closes due to the fusion of the Septum primum and the Endocardial cushion. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because it is not the correct sequence of fusion. Option C is the correct sequence, but it is not the reason why the Fossa ovalis closes. Therefore, the answer is D)None.\n\n"}, {"question": "Mouth to mouth respiration provides what percentage of oxygen ?", "correct_answer": "16%", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)10%", "B)16%", "C)21%", "D)100%"], "prompt": "Mouth to mouth respiration provides what percentage of oxygen ?A)10%\nB)16%\nC)21%\nD)100%", "subject_name": "Anaesthesia", "output0": "Mouth to mouth respiration provides approximately 10% of the total oxygen needed by the body.
