This is because the patient's symptoms of episodic shortness of breath and chest tightness, along with his history of heavy physical exertion and sudden loss of consciousness, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia or coronary artery disease. CT angiography would be the most appropriate test to confirm this diagnosis, as it would allow for a visualization of the coronary arteries and any blockages or abnormalities.\n\n", "output1": "An echocardiogram is most likely to confirm the diagnosis of a cardiac cause for the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of episodic shortness of breath and chest tightness, along with his recent loss of consciousness, suggest a possible cardiac etiology. An echocardiogram can help to identify any structural abnormalities or dysfunction of the heart muscle, which may be responsible for the patient's symptoms.\n\n", "output2": "Cardiac enzymes are most likely to confirm the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is suspected based on the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness. The fact that the patient has a history of episodic shortness of breath and chest tightness while playing tennis suggests that he may have coronary artery disease, which can lead to ACS. Cardiac enzymes, such as troponin, are proteins that are released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged, as in the case of ACS. Measuring cardiac enzymes can help confirm the diagnosis of ACS and rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Electroencephalogram. The patient's symptoms of episodic shortness of breath and chest tightness, along with the absence of chest pain and the normal results of the physical examination, suggest that the cause of his symptoms is likely to be a neurological rather than a cardiovascular problem. An electroencephalogram (EEG) would be the most appropriate test to confirm this diagnosis, as it can help to identify any abnormal electrical activity in the brain that may be causing the patient's symptoms.\n\n"}, {"question": "Sudden hyperflexion of thigh over abdomen (Mc Roberts manoeuvre) with of the following nerve is commonly involved?", "correct_answer": "Lateral cutaneous Nerve of thigh", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Common peroneal nerve", "B)Obturator nerve", "C)Lumbosacral trunk", "D)Lateral cutaneous Nerve of thigh"], "prompt": "Sudden hyperflexion of thigh over abdomen (Mc Roberts manoeuvre) with of the following nerve is commonly involved?A)Common peroneal nerve\nB)Obturator nerve\nC)Lumbosacral trunk\nD)Lateral cutaneous Nerve of thigh", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The Common Peroneal Nerve is commonly involved in the Mc Roberts manoeuvre, which is a technique used to assess the integrity of the common peroneal nerve.
