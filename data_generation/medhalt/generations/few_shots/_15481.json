In fact, studies have shown that individuals with O blood type may have a lower risk of developing stomach cancer compared to individuals with other blood types.\n\n", "output2": "Partial gastrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a portion of the stomach. This procedure does not increase the risk of stomach cancer (gastric adenocarcinoma) because it eliminates the precancerous lesions that are present in the stomach. In fact, partial gastrectomy is often performed to treat stomach cancer.\n\n", "output3": "Pernicious anemia is not a risk factor for stomach cancer (gastric adenocarcinoma). In fact, pernicious anemia is a condition in which the body is unable to absorb vitamin B12, which can lead to a deficiency in this nutrient.
