This is because Aedes mosquitoes are not strong fliers and can only travel short distances.\n\n", "output1": "The Aedes mosquito, which is the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, has a very short flight range of less than 100 meters. This means that the mosquitoes are unlikely to travel long distances and are more likely to be found in close proximity to their breeding sites.\n\n", "output2": "The Aedes mosquito, the primary vector of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, has a flight range of approximately 400 meters.\n\n", "output3": "The range of flight of Aedes mosquitoes is approximately 10 km.
