High pull headgear, on the other hand, can be too strong and may cause the upper teeth to move too far forward, while reverse pull headgear may not provide enough force to correct the malocclusion. Cervical headgear is not typically used for class II div. 1 malocclusions.\n\n", "output2": "Cervical headgear is the preferred choice for treating class II div. 1 malocclusions with a horizontal growth trend. This is because it provides a more stable and comfortable fit for the patient, and is less likely to cause discomfort or pain compared to other types of headgear.\n\n", "output3": "Reverse pull headgear is preferred for treating a Class II div. 1 malocclusion with a horizontal growth trend because it helps to control the growth of the upper jaw and guide the teeth into the correct position. The reverse pull headgear is designed to apply a force in the opposite direction of the growth pattern of the upper jaw, which helps to slow down or stop the growth of the upper jaw and guide the teeth into the correct position.\n\n"}, {"question": "In arthroscopy, for TMJ adhesion lysis, the laser used is:", "correct_answer": "Ho-Yag", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Ho-Yag", "B)Er-Yag", "C)He-Ne", "D)Argon"], "prompt": "In arthroscopy, for TMJ adhesion lysis, the laser used is:A)Ho-Yag\nB)Er-Yag\nC)He-Ne\nD)Argon", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "Ho-Yag lasers are the most commonly used lasers for TMJ adhesion lysis in arthroscopy.
