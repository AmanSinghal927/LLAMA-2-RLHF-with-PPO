This means that X-rays are more likely to be scattered by the crystal lattice of a material, producing a distinctive peak in the diffraction pattern.\n\n", "output1": "The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in protons because they have a higher momentum than electrons and are therefore more easily deflected by the crystal lattice. This effect is used in X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules.\n\n", "output2": "The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in neutrons because they have a much longer wavelength than electrons, which means that they are more sensitive to the crystal structure of materials. This effect is used in neutron scattering experiments to study the structure and properties of materials.\n\n", "output3": "The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in electrons because they have a shorter wavelength and a higher frequency than protons, neutrons, and X-rays.

As a result, fructose accumulates in the liver and is excreted in the urine, leading to the formation of hexagonal crystals.
