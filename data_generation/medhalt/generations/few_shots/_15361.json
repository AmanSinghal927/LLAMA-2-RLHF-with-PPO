This can lead to a decrease in bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis.\n\n", "output1": "Menopause is a period of significant hormonal change, and the loss of estrogen can lead to a decrease in calcium absorption and bone density. This decrease in calcium requirements is why the answer is correct.\n\n", "output2": "The maximum adult bone mass is typically reached around the age of 45 years, which coincides with the onset of menopause in women. During this stage, the body's ability to absorb calcium from the diet decreases, making it essential to consume adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis.\n\n", "output3": "During menopause, women experience a decrease in estrogen levels, which can lead to a decrease in bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis. However, regular exercise and physical activity can help to maintain bone mass and prevent osteoporosis by stimulating calcium deposition in the bones.\n\n"}, {"question": "Azoospermia with normal FSH would indicate ?", "correct_answer": "Obstruction of vas defrens", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Hypothalamic failure", "B)Testicular failure", "C)Obstruction of vas defrens", "D)All of the above"], "prompt": "Azoospermia with normal FSH would indicate ?A)Hypothalamic failure\nB)Testicular failure\nC)Obstruction of vas defrens\nD)All of the above", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "Azoospermia with normal FSH indicates hypothalamic failure, as the pituitary gland is producing normal amounts of FSH but the testes are not responding.
