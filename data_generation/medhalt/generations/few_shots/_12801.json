Additionally, the saorius muscle is a thin muscle that can be easily penetrated with a needle, making it an ideal location for implanting the parathyroid gland.\n\n", "output1": "The parathyroid gland is implanted in the supinator muscle because it is a muscle that is located near the neck and is easily accessible for surgical implantation. Additionally, the supinator muscle is a relatively small muscle, which makes it a good choice for implantation of a small organ like the parathyroid gland.\n\n", "output2": "The parathyroid gland is implanted in the deltoid muscle because it is a muscle that is easily accessible and can be easily reached during surgical procedures.

This is because dental floss is the most effective tool for cleaning between teeth with a wide open interdental space.\n\n", "output1": "The interdental brush is the most recommended method for cleaning interdental spaces when there is a complete loss of papilla and a wide open interdental space. This is because it is able to reach into the space between the teeth and clean effectively, even in areas where dental floss and wood sticks may not be able to reach.\n\n", "output2": "In case of complete loss of papilla and a wide open interdental space, the best interdental cleaning method is a wood stick. This is because a wood stick is long and thin, allowing it to reach deep into the interdental space and effectively clean the area. Dental floss and interdental brushes may not be able to reach the entire interdental space in this case.\n\n", "output3": "All of the methods you mentioned (dental floss, interdental brush, and wood stick) are effective for cleaning interdental spaces, and may be recommended depending on the individual's needs and preferences.
