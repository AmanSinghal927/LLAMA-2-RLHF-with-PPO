This is the most common site for endoscopic esophageal rupture to occur. The rupture can be caused by a variety of factors, including excessive pressure from endoscopic instruments, inadequate sedation, or the presence of a pre-existing esophageal tear.\n\n", "output1": "The most common cause of endoscopic esophageal rupture is the thoracic inlet area, which is the area where the esophagus passes through the diaphragm. This area is prone to injury due to the narrow and flexible nature of the esophagus, which can make it more susceptible to tearing.\n\n", "output2": "The cricopharyngeal area is the most common site of endoscopic esophageal rupture. This is because the cricopharyngeal muscle is the most distensible portion of the esophageal wall, and it is also the area where the esophagus is most narrow. As a result, the risk of tearing or rupture is higher in this area.\n\n", "output3": "The aortic arch area is the most common site of endoscopic esophageal rupture. This is because the esophagus passes through the aortic arch, and the pressure exerted by the aortic arch can cause the esophageal wall to weaken and rupture.\n\n"}, {"question": "Achiral molecules that contain centers of chirality are called:", "correct_answer": "Meso forms.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Enantiomers", "B)Diastereoisomers.", "C)Meso forms.", "D)Racemic."], "prompt": "Achiral molecules that contain centers of chirality are called:A)Enantiomers\nB)Diastereoisomers.\nC)Meso forms.\nD)Racemic.", "subject_name": "chemistry", "output0": "Achiral molecules that contain centers of chirality are called enantiomers because they have the same physical properties, but differ in their optical activity.
