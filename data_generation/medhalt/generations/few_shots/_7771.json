Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), which is a type of brain damage that can cause the symptoms described, is more common in infants born to mothers over the age of 35. This is because as women get older, their eggs are more likely to have genetic mutations that can increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and other complications during pregnancy. Additionally, older mothers are more likely to have pregnancy-related complications such as hypertension and diabetes, which can also increase the risk of PVL.\n\n"}, {"question": "According to Frankel's behavior rating scale, a positive child:", "correct_answer": "May become uncooperative during treatment.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)May become uncooperative during treatment.", "B)Reluctant to accept treatment.", "C)Good rapport with the dentist.", "D)Show slight negativism"], "prompt": "According to Frankel's behavior rating scale, a positive child:A)May become uncooperative during treatment.\nB)Reluctant to accept treatment.\nC)Good rapport with the dentist.\nD)Show slight negativism", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Frankel's behavior rating scale is a tool used to assess a child's behavior during dental treatment.
