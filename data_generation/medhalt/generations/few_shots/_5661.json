The aqueous humor is the clear fluid that fills the front part of the eye and helps maintain its shape. The patient's occupation as a tower crane operator may have exposed him to excessive amounts of UV radiation, which can cause damage to the aqueous humor and lead to symptoms such as blurred vision and glare. The visual acuity of 20/100 in both eyes and the photograph of the eye are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's symptoms of blurring of vision and glare in the evenings are consistent with a vitreomacular traction, which is caused by the vitreous body pulling on the retina. The damage to the vitreous body is most likely responsible for the patient's current symptoms.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of blurring of vision and glare in the evenings, along with the physical examination findings of decreased visual acuity, are consistent with cataracts. The lens is the structure most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's symptoms of blurring of vision and glare, along with the finding of a visual acuity of 20/100 in both eyes, are consistent with a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a condition that affects the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. The photograph of the eye shows typical changes of AMD, including drusen and geographic atrophy. Therefore, the most likely structure responsible for the patient's symptoms is the retina.\n\n"}, {"question": "In which of these drugs with antiviral activity does an open structure of acyclonucleoside appear ?:", "correct_answer": "Ganciclovir", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Zidovudine", "B)Ribavirin", "C)Lamivudine", "D)Ganciclovir"], "prompt": "In which of these drugs with antiviral activity does an open structure of acyclonucleoside appear ?:A)Zidovudine\nB)Ribavirin\nC)Lamivudine\nD)Ganciclovir", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "The open structure of acyclonucleoside is present in Zidovudine.
