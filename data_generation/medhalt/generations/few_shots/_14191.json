The presence of more undifferentiated neural tissue is associated with a better prognosis, as it indicates that the tumor is more likely to be benign and less aggressive.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)degree of glandular differentiation. In immature teratomas, the degree of glandular differentiation is an important prognostic factor. The more differentiated the glands are, the better the prognosis.\n\n", "output2": "The presence of solid parts more than cystic parts is a favorable prognostic factor for immature teratomas. This is because solid parts are more likely to be mature tissues, which have a better chance of being successfully removed during surgery.\n\n", "output3": "The presence of sexual pseudoprecocity is an important factor in the prognosis of an immature teratoma. This is because the presence of mature teratoma is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and malignant transformation.\n\n"}, {"question": "Antidiuretic hormone (anti-diuretic hormone) syndrome of inappropriate secretion (SIADH), which will result in the following electrolyte abnormalities?", "correct_answer": "Low \u9209\u8840 disease", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)High \u9209\u8840 disease", "B)Low \u9209\u8840 disease", "C)Hyperkalemia", "D)Hypokalemia"], "prompt": "Antidiuretic hormone (anti-diuretic hormone) syndrome of inappropriate secretion (SIADH), which will result in the following electrolyte abnormalities?A)High \u9209\u8840 disease\nB)Low \u9209\u8840 disease\nC)Hyperkalemia\nD)Hypokalemia", "subject_name": null, "output0": "SIADH can cause an excessive retention of water in the body, leading to high blood sodium levels (hyponatremia).
