This is because mammography is not as effective in women under 40, and it may also cause false positives.\n\n", "output1": "The sensitivity of mammography in women aged 50 years and older is lower compared to younger women due to the natural aging process of the breast tissue. This is because the breast tissue becomes less dense and more fatty as we age, which can make it more difficult to detect small tumors.\n\n", "output2": "Breast fat ratio can affect the sensitivity of mammography because fatty tissue can obscure the visibility of tumors on the X-ray.
