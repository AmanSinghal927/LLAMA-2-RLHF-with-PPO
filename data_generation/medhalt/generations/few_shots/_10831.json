The cotton wool appearance on the liver tumor CT scan is a common sign of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, it is recommended to dispose of surgery as soon as possible to establish the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.\n\n", "output2": "The statement C)Liver tumors may hemangioma, regardless of the clinical symptoms, it is recommended to closely observe is incorrect because it is not recommended to closely observe liver tumors that are high echoic (Hyperechoic) on ultrasound, as they are more likely to be malignant.

This is important because multiple myeloma can cause bleeding disorders, and the patient's symptoms of darkening of the skin and ear necrosis may be related to this.\n\n", "output2": "Anti-nuclear antibodies are commonly associated with autoimmune disorders, such as lupus.
