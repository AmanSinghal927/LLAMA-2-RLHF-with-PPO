This bacteria is found in the oral flora of children during the pubertal stage and is responsible for the development of dental caries and periodontal disease.\n\n", "output1": "Capnocytophaga is a bacterium that predominates in puberty gingivitis, which is a common condition that affects adolescents. This bacterium is responsible for the production of extracellular matrix components that contribute to the formation of dental plaque and tartar.\n\n", "output2": "P. Intermedia is a bacterium that is commonly found in the mouths of children during puberty and is known to cause gingivitis. It produces extracellular matrix proteins that can lead to the formation of dental plaque and tartar, which in turn can cause inflammation and irritation of the gums.\n\n", "output3": "A. A. Comitans is the predominant bacteria in puberty gingivitis because it produces a toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the gums. Additionally, the hormonal changes that occur during puberty can cause an increase in the amount of bacteria in the mouth, making it more difficult to maintain good oral hygiene.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following anesthetic agent most is lipid soluble?", "correct_answer": "Methoxyflurane", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Nitrous oxide", "B)Methoxyflurane", "C)Isoflurane", "D)Halothane"], "prompt": "Which of the following anesthetic agent most is lipid soluble?A)Nitrous oxide\nB)Methoxyflurane\nC)Isoflurane\nD)Halothane", "subject_name": "Anaesthesia", "output0": "Nitrous oxide is a lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, which means it can easily dissolve in the fatty tissues of the body.
