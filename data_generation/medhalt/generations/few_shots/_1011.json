The copper IUD can increase the risk of VTE and worsen the symptoms of stroke.\n\n", "output1": "Past or active pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a contraindication for copper IUD placement. This is because PID can lead to scarring and adhesions in the pelvic cavity, which can increase the risk of complications such as perforation or expulsion of the IUD. In addition, copper IUDs are not recommended for women with a history of PID due to the risk of recurrence of the infection.\n\n", "output2": "Past medical history of breast cancer is a contraindication for copper IUD placement because the copper in the IUD can increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence. This is particularly true for women with a history of hormone-sensitive breast cancer, as the copper can stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors.\n\n", "output3": "The use of copper IUDs is contraindicated in patients with known liver neoplasm, as the copper can accumulate in the liver and potentially worsen the condition.

This type of pregnancy is more common in older children and adolescents, as their reproductive systems are more developed and able to support the pregnancy.\n\n", "output1": "If the placenta is densely adhered to the uterus, it should be separated along with the organ it overlies, as leaving it behind can lead to infection. This is especially important in cases of abdominal pregnancy, as the placenta is more likely to be adhered to the abdominal wall.\n\n", "output2": "According to the text, around 50% of the fetuses in abdominal pregnancies reach full term and survive. This means that the chances of the fetus surviving are relatively high in this type of pregnancy.\n\n", "output3": "If the placenta is left behind during an abdominal pregnancy, there is a risk of infection. This is because the placenta provides a barrier between the fetus and the mother's bloodstream, and if it is left behind, the fetus can be exposed to bacteria and other pathogens that can cause infection.\n\n"}, {"question": "Endo-cochlear potential is:", "correct_answer": "+85 mV", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)+45 mV", "B)--45mV", "C)-60mV", "D)+85 mV"], "prompt": "Endo-cochlear potential is:A)+45 mV\nB)--45mV\nC)-60mV\nD)+85 mV", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "The endo-cochlear potential is the electrical potential that exists across the inner ear and is measured in millivolts (mV).
