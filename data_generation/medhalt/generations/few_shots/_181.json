It is also available over-the-counter, which makes it a good option for the patient who has previously taken an over-the-counter medication.\n\n", "output2": "Diphenhydramine is less likely to cause drowsiness than other antihistamines such as cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine. This is because it has a longer half-life and stays in the body for a longer period of time, which means it takes longer for the body to metabolize and excrete it. This can result in less sedation and drowsiness, making it a better option for someone who needs to drive.\n\n", "output3": "Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that is less likely to cause drowsiness compared to other medications such as chlorpheniramine or diphenhydramine. It is a good option for patients who need to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking medication.
