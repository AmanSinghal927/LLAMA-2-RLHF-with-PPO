The fact that she experiences improvement after exercise is also consistent with this diagnosis. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms.\n\n", "output2": "The symptoms described, such as weakness that improves after exercise, along with the bladder incontinence, are consistent with Myasthenia Gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and muscles.
