This would be the most likely functional maneuver to be deficient on physical exam.\n\n", "output1": "If the patient has a torn supraspinatus, he would likely have difficulty performing external rotation due to pain and weakness in the affected muscle. This would be reflected on physical exam as a deficient external rotation range of motion.\n\n", "output2": "If the patient has a torn supraspinatus, he would likely have difficulty initiating abduction of the shoulder, as this muscle is responsible for this movement.

Passive diffusion is a more simple process that does not require energy.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Facilitated diffusion because this is the primary mechanism by which drugs are transported across biological membranes. Facilitated diffusion is a process that uses a carrier protein to transport drugs across the membrane, and it is the most common mechanism of drug transport.\n\n", "output2": "Active transport is the primary mechanism by which drugs are transported across biological membranes. This is because the drugs are actively transported into the cell through a carrier protein, which requires energy to move the drug across the membrane.\n\n", "output3": "Endocytosis is the process by which cells take in molecules and particles from the outside environment by engulfing them in vesicles. This mechanism is important for the transport of drugs across biological membranes, as it allows the drugs to be taken up by the cells and reach their intended target.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician because her mother is concerned about her lack of appetite and poor weight gain.
