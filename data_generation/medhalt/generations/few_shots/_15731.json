This is because D1 implants are made from a titanium alloy that is more biocompatible and has a rougher surface that promotes bone growth.\n\n", "output1": "The D1 and D2 bones provide the best osteointegration because they are the most prominent bones in the mandible and have the largest surface area for implant placement. This allows for better anchorage and stability of the dental implant.\n\n", "output2": "The Turtle Technique involves the use of dental implants, which are made of titanium. Titanium is a biocompatible material that is well-suited for use in the human body.
