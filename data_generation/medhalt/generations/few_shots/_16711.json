The patient\u2019s history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the fact that she recently had an unfortunate sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs suggest that she may have a hypercoagulable state, which can increase the risk of DVT.

The presence of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein on Doppler ultrasound confirms this diagnosis. Vitamin K deficiency is a known risk factor for DVT, and the patient\u2019s history of spontaneous abortion and systemic lupus erythematosus increase her risk for vitamin K deficiency.
