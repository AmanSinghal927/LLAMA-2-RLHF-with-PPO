The patient's weakness in the lower limbs is likely caused by the muscle wasting effects of corticosteroid use.\n\n", "output2": "The drug that is most likely responsible for the patient's muscle weakness is the one that inhibits myosin light-chain kinase.

These antigens are responsible for protecting the red blood cells from being destroyed by the immune system. Without these antigens, the red blood cells are more susceptible to hemolysis, which can lead to the production of hemoglobinuria.\n\n", "output2": "The reason why hemolytic patients have paroxysmal nocturnal urinary hemoglobin (paroxysmal nocturnic hemoglobinuria) is because there is a lack of CD15 and CD25 antigens on the surface of red blood cells.
