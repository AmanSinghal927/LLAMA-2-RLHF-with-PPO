This process is known as the ATP-PCr energy system, which is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction. The ATP molecules are then used to drive the contraction of the muscle fibers.\n\n", "output2": "Muscle contraction begins with the hydrolysis of crossed bridges, which are the bonds between the actin and myosin filaments. The hydrolysis of these bonds causes the actin filaments to move, which in turn causes the myosin filaments to slide along the actin filaments, leading to muscle contraction.\n\n", "output3": "Muscle contraction begins with the elongation of the sarcomere, which is the basic contractile unit of muscle.
