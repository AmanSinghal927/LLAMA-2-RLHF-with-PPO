This is a normal part of the developmental process and usually resolves on its own without any intervention.\n\n", "output1": "Physiological adhesions between the foreskin and glans penis persist until around the age of 5. This is because the foreskin is not fully retractable until the child is around 5 years old.\n\n", "output2": "Physiological adhesions between the foreskin and glans penis persist until around 6 years of age. This is because the foreskin is attached to the glans penis by a frenulum, which gradually becomes less prominent as the child grows. By around 6 years of age, the frenulum has usually disappeared, and the foreskin is no longer attached to the glans penis.\n\n", "output3": "Physiological adhesions between the foreskin and glans penis typically persist until the age of 7, as the foreskin and glans penis are still developing and maturing.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 42-year-old male was found in the neck and lower face has a prominent lump; and the patient complained of swallowing a foreign body sensation, speech can not speak for too long.

This is because gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to the antibacterial effects of saliva and the immune system than gram-negative bacteria. As a result, the plaque microflora shifts towards gram-positive bacteria, which can lead to an increase in the accumulation of plaque and tartar.\n\n", "output2": "Over time, the plaque microflora undergoes changes that result in a shift towards a more gram-negative composition. This is because gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to antimicrobial agents and are therefore more likely to be present in the oral microbiome later in life.\n\n", "output3": "The plaque microflora undergoes changes with time, and the predominant microorganisms shift from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria, including spirochetes. This is why the plaque microflora becomes predominantly spirochetal over time.\n\n"}, {"question": "A physician is involved in a research collaboration with a pharmaceutical company.
