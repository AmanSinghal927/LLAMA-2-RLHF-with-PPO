Cushing's syndrome is caused by excessive production of cortisol, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as adrenal hyperplasia, pituitary adenoma, and other tumors. Small cell lung cancer is a type of lung cancer that is not related to Cushing's syndrome.\n\n", "output1": "Anterior pituitary adenoma is not a cause of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome is caused by excessive secretion of cortisol and/or ACTH from the adrenal glands or the pituitary gland. Anterior pituitary adenoma is a benign tumor that can cause excessive secretion of other hormones, such as growth hormone and prolactin, but it does not cause Cushing's syndrome.\n\n", "output2": "Adrenal hyperplasia is not a cause of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome is caused by excessive production of cortisol, which is typically due to a tumor in the pituitary gland or adrenal gland. Adrenal hyperplasia, on the other hand, is a condition where the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol due to a genetic defect.\n\n", "output3": "AMH (Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone) is not a cause of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body, often due to a pituitary tumor or an adrenal gland tumor. AMH is a hormone produced by the ovaries in women and is not related to Cushing's syndrome.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which type of porosity is seen in case of rapid solidification of molten alloy:", "correct_answer": "Microporosity", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Subsurface porosity", "B)Suck back porosity", "C)Microporosity", "D)Localized shrinkage porosity"], "prompt": "Which type of porosity is seen in case of rapid solidification of molten alloy:A)Subsurface porosity\nB)Suck back porosity\nC)Microporosity\nD)Localized shrinkage porosity", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Subsurface porosity is seen in case of rapid solidification of molten alloy because the solidification process occurs too quickly for the molten material to form a stable crystal structure. As a result, the porosity is trapped within the solidified material.\n\n", "output1": "Suck back porosity is a type of porosity that occurs during rapid solidification of molten alloys. As the molten metal solidifies, it can become trapped in the pores of the mold, creating a vacuum or \"suck back\" effect. This type of porosity is more common in alloys that have a high cooling rate, such as those produced by rapid solidification techniques.\n\n", "output2": "Microporosity is seen in cases of rapid solidification of molten alloy because it is the result of the rapid cooling process. As the alloy cools quickly, the pores that form are small and uniform, resulting in microporosity.\n\n", "output3": "Localized shrinkage porosity is a type of porosity that is commonly seen in cases of rapid solidification of molten alloys. This type of porosity is caused by the rapid cooling rate, which does not allow the formation of a stable solidification structure. The result is a localized area of porosity that is often seen as small, round, and spherical-shaped bubbles.\n\n"}, {"question": "Narcolepsy, not true ?", "correct_answer": "Sleep architecture normal", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Cataplexy", "B)Sleep architecture normal", "C)Loss of muscle tone", "D)Hallucination"], "prompt": "Narcolepsy, not true ?A)Cataplexy\nB)Sleep architecture normal\nC)Loss of muscle tone\nD)Hallucination", "subject_name": "Psychiatry", "output0": "Cataplexy is a symptom of narcolepsy, a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate sleep and wakefulness.

While people with narcolepsy may experience cataplexy (loss of muscle tone), hallucinations, and other symptoms, their sleep architecture is typically normal.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Loss of muscle tone. This is because narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles, and one of the symptoms of narcolepsy is a loss of muscle tone, which can lead to cataplexy.\n\n", "output3": "Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. One of the symptoms of narcolepsy is hallucinations, which can be visual, auditory, or both.
