This is because the displacement can cause the blood supply to the bone to be disrupted, leading to AVN. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n", "output1": "A proximal humerus fracture has a higher risk of developing avascular necrosis (AVN) when there are two paired fractures. This is because the blood supply to the bone is disrupted, which can lead to bone death and deformity.\n\n", "output2": "The risk of avascular necrosis (AVN) is highest in proximal humerus fractures that involve the greater tuberosity, which is the area of bone that is most susceptible to AVN. In these fractures, the blood supply to the bone is compromised, leading to a higher risk of AVN. Therefore, the answer is C)Three pa.\n\n", "output3": "The proximal humerus is a bone that is more susceptible to avascular necrosis (AVN) after fracture. Studies have shown that fractures in this bone have a higher risk of developing AVN, especially if the fracture is displaced. Therefore, option D) Four pa is the correct answer.\n\n"}, {"question": "Fastest receptor mediated action is through ?", "correct_answer": "Intrinsic ion channels", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Cell membrane receptors", "B)Intrinsic ion channels", "C)Enzyme linked receptors", "D)Intracellular receptors"], "prompt": "Fastest receptor mediated action is through ?A)Cell membrane receptors\nB)Intrinsic ion channels\nC)Enzyme linked receptors\nD)Intracellular receptors", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "Cell membrane receptors are the fastest receptor mediated action because they are located on the cell membrane and can quickly respond to changes in the extracellular environment.\n\n", "output1": "Fastest receptor mediated action is through intrinsic ion channels because they are directly linked to the ion channels within the cell membrane, allowing for rapid signal transduction.\n\n", "output2": "Enzyme-linked receptors are the fastest receptor-mediated action. They activate intracellular enzymes that catalyze a chemical reaction, which can occur within seconds.\n\n", "output3": "Intracellular receptors are the fastest receptor-mediated action because they are located inside the cell and do not require the signal to travel through the extracellular space. This means that the response is faster and more efficient.\n\n"}, {"question": "False about Pott's spine", "correct_answer": "Always heals by chemotherapy", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Commonest at dorsolumbar junction", "B)Always heals by chemotherapy", "C)Back pain is an early symptom", "D)There is disc space narrowing on x-ray"], "prompt": "False about Pott's spineA)Commonest at dorsolumbar junction\nB)Always heals by chemotherapy\nC)Back pain is an early symptom\nD)There is disc space narrowing on x-ray", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "Pott's spine is the most common form of tuberculosis in the spine, and it is most commonly found at the dorsolumbar junction (the area where the thoracic and lumbar spine meet). This is because the dorsolumbar junction is a region of the spine that is more prone to infection due to its proximity to the diaphragm and the rib cage.\n\n", "output1": "The statement \"Always heals by chemotherapy\" is false. Pott's spine is a type of tuberculosis that affects the spine, and it is not always treated with chemotherapy. In fact, the treatment of Pott's spine usually involves a combination of antibiotics and surgery.\n\n", "output2": "Back pain is an early symptom of Pott's spine because the infection can cause inflammation and damage to the spine, which can lead to pain and discomfort.\n\n", "output3": "Option D is the correct answer because disc space narrowing is a common finding on x-rays in cases of Pott's spine.\n\n"}, {"question": "Chronic alcoholic comes with pain epigastrium and recurrent vomiting.

The endoscopy will allow for a visual inspection of the upper gastrointestinal tract and can help to diagnose any underlying conditions such as gastritis, esophagitis, or gastric ulcers.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's symptoms of pain in the upper epigastrium and recurrent vomiting are consistent with acute pancreatitis, which is often associated with alcohol consumption. A serum lipase test would be an appropriate next step to help confirm the diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of pain in the epigastrium and recurrent vomiting are concerning for a possible gastrointestinal (GI) cause. The presence of guarding, which is a protective reflex, suggests that there may be an inflammatory process in the abdomen. A CECT (Computed Tomography Enterography) scan is the next best step to evaluate the GI tract and rule out any inflammatory or obstructive causes.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's symptoms of pain epigastrium and recurrent vomiting suggest a possible diagnosis of acute alcoholic pancreatitis.

This is because the peptide bond is formed by the condensation reaction between two amino acids, and the cis configuration is the most stable form of this reaction.\n\n", "output1": "The trans configuration is the most frequent configuration of the peptide bond in proteins. This is because the trans configuration is more stable than the cis configuration, and therefore, it is more common in proteins.\n\n", "output2": "The cis configuration is more common in animal proteins, while the trans configuration is more common in plant proteins. This is because the cis configuration is more stable and less prone to degradation, which is important for the structural and functional properties of proteins in animals.\n\n", "output3": "Proteins can exist in two different configurations: cis and trans. The cis configuration is when the peptide bond is formed between two amino acids that are on the same side of the polypeptide chain, while the trans configuration is when the peptide bond is formed between two amino acids that are on opposite sides of the polypeptide chain.
