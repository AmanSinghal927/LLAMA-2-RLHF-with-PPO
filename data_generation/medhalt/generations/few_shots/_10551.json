This type of response is characterized by the rapid release of histamine and other chemicals that help to fight off the allergen and reduce inflammation.\n\n", "output2": "When Chen experienced a severe asthma attack, his immune system responded by producing autoimmune antibodies that attacked the alveolar basement membrane, leading to the development of asthma symptoms.\n\n", "output3": "Exposure to allergens can weaken the immune system and make it more susceptible to infection. In the case of Chen, the exposure to dust mites triggered an allergic reaction and led to a severe asthma attack, which in turn weakened his immune system and made him more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia.\n\n"}, {"question": "Citrate used in fatty acid synthesis uses which enzyme ?", "correct_answer": "ATP citrate lyase", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Citrate Synthase", "B)ATP citrate lyase", "C)Aconitase", "D)Malic enzyme"], "prompt": "Citrate used in fatty acid synthesis uses which enzyme ?A)Citrate Synthase\nB)ATP citrate lyase\nC)Aconitase\nD)Malic enzyme", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "output0": "Citrate is converted to isocitrate by citrate synthase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction.
