This is because glucose is a readily available source of energy for the body, and it can help to replenish the body's stores of glucose and electrolytes. Additionally, a 10% glucose solution is isotonic, meaning it has the same osmolarity as blood, which can help to prevent further dehydration.\n\n", "output1": "Distilled water is the most appropriate intravenous fluid to use in a patient suffering from dehydration secondary to diarrhea, as it is isotonic and does not contain any electrolytes that may be lost due to the diarrhea.\n\n", "output2": "0.9% saline is the most appropriate intravenous fluid to use in a patient with dehydration secondary to diarrhea, because it contains a balanced amount of electrolytes and fluids that can help to rehydrate the patient without causing an imbalance in electrolyte levels.\n\n", "output3": "5% glucose solution is used to treat dehydration caused by diarrhea because it contains a higher concentration of glucose than other intravenous fluids.
