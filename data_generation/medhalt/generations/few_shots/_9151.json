This is because the external jugular vein is larger and more superficial than the internal jugular vein, making it easier to access and navigate. Additionally, the external jugular vein is more visible and easier to palpate, which can make the procedure more straightforward and less risky.\n\n", "output1": "When considering long-term use, the subclavian vein is a more appropriate choice than the femoral vein for central venous catheter placement. This is because the subclavian vein has a lower risk of thrombosis and infection compared to the femoral vein, which can lead to complications such as thrombophlebitis and sepsis.\n\n", "output2": "When a central venous catheter is placed, a high Trendelenburg posture (Trendelenburg position) can help to easily inflate the internal jugular vein, which can make the placement of the catheter easier and more successful.

This structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the amino acids, and is distinct from the primary structure (the sequence of amino acids) and tertiary structure (the overall 3D shape of the protein).\n\n", "output1": "The secondary structure of protein is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are formed between two cysteine residues. The secondary structure includes the alpha helices and beta sheets, which are the most common structures found in proteins.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is that all three structures (primary, secondary, and tertiary) are destroyed during denaturation. Denaturation is the process of unraveling the protein's native structure, which causes the protein to lose its three-dimensional shape and become a random coil. As a result, all three structures are disrupted and destroyed.\n\n", "output3": "The secondary and tertiary structures of protein depend on the sequence of amino acids because the sequence determines the chemical properties of the protein, which in turn determines the way it folds and interacts with other molecules.\n\n"}, {"question": "Most common etiology of erythema multiforme is?", "correct_answer": "Idiopathic", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Idiopathic", "B)Drugs", "C)HSV", "D)TB"], "prompt": "Most common etiology of erythema multiforme is?A)Idiopathic\nB)Drugs\nC)HSV\nD)TB", "subject_name": "Skin", "output0": "Erythema multiforme is a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, allergies, and certain medications.
