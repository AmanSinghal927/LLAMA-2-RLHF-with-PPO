This is calculated using the odds ratio, which is a measure of the strength of the association between a risk factor (smoking) and an outcome (emphysema). In this case, the odds ratio is calculated as the ratio of the odds of developing emphysema among smokers (200/1000) to the odds of developing emphysema among non-smokers (20/1000). This gives an odds ratio of 10, which can be converted to a relative risk using the formula: relative risk = odds ratio / 1 + odds ratio. In this case, the relative risk is 2, which means that the risk of developing emphysema is 2 times higher among smokers than among non-smokers. To calculate the percentage of the risk that can be attributed to smoking, we can multiply the relative risk by 100, which gives 20%.\n\n", "output2": "The percentage of the risk of developing emphysema that can be attributed to smoking is 10%.

The odds ratio is calculated as the ratio of the odds of developing emphysema in smokers to the odds of developing emphysema in non-smokers.
