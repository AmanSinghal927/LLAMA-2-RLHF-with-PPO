Hypoglycemia is caused by inhibition of this enzyme, which is responsible for breaking down glucose 6-phosphate to glucose.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Glycogen phosphorylase because hypoglycemia is due to the inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase, which is an enzyme that breaks down glycogen into glucose. When the body is not receiving enough glucose, glycogen phosphorylase is inhibited, leading to a decrease in glucose production and an increase in hypoglycemia.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is Pyruvate Carboxylase because when the body is not receiving enough glucose from the diet, it will break down stored glycogen and convert it to glucose. Pyruvate Carboxylase is an enzyme that helps to convert pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used to produce ATP.\n\n", "output3": "Glucokinase is an enzyme that facilitates the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into the liver and muscle cells. When the body is not getting enough glucose, as in the case of hypoglycemia, glucokinase activity is inhibited, leading to decreased glucose uptake and storage.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is a side effect of clofazimine?", "correct_answer": "Reddish black skin discoloration", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Reddish black skin discoloration", "B)Hemolytic anaemia", "C)Flu like syndrome", "D)Axillary freckling"], "prompt": "Which of the following is a side effect of clofazimine?A)Reddish black skin discoloration\nB)Hemolytic anaemia\nC)Flu like syndrome\nD)Axillary freckling", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "Clofazimine is an antibiotic that can cause a side effect known as \"reddish black skin discoloration.\" This is a rare side effect, but it can occur in some individuals who are taking the medication.\n\n", "output1": "Clofazimine can cause hemolytic anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced.\n\n", "output2": "Clofazimine is a medication that can cause flu-like side effects, such as fever, chills, and muscle aches.
