When a person consumes too much choline, it can lead to an overproduction of sweat, which can be uncomfortable and potentially lead to dehydration.\n\n", "output1": "Biotin is a B vitamin that is associated with excessive sweating. Consuming high amounts of biotin can lead to vitamin toxicity, which can cause symptoms such as excessive sweating, nausea, and skin rashes.\n\n", "output2": "Folic acid is associated with excessive sweating due to its role in regulating body temperature. When the body has too much folic acid, it can cause an overheating effect, leading to excessive sweating.\n\n", "output3": "Vitamin B is associated with excessive sweating because it can cause a condition called hyperhidrosis, which is characterized by excessive sweating. This can be a problem for children who are taking high doses of vitamin B, as it can lead to discomfort and social anxiety.\n\n"}, {"question": "Increase in muscle mass at adolescence is probably caused by \u2013", "correct_answer": "Growth harmone", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Thyroid hormone", "B)Adrenal hormone", "C)Growth harmone", "D)None of the above"], "prompt": "Increase in muscle mass at adolescence is probably caused by \u2013A)Thyroid hormone\nB)Adrenal hormone\nC)Growth harmone\nD)None of the above", "subject_name": "Pediatrics", "output0": "Thyroid hormone is responsible for regulating growth and development, particularly during adolescence.
