These alloys consist of two distinct phases, which can provide a high strength-to-weight ratio and improved corrosion resistance.\n\n", "output2": "High copper single composition alloys have the least creep value because they have the highest strength and stiffness. Creep is a phenomenon that occurs when a material is subjected to a constant load over a long period of time, and it causes the material to deform.
