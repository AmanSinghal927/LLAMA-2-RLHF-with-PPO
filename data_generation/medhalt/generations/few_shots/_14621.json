The other options, such as miosis (constricted pupils), smooth skin, and tremulousness, are not typically associated with naloxone administration.\n\n", "output1": "The reversal agent administered to the patient is likely to be naloxone, which is used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose. One of the effects of naloxone is to cause miosis, or pinpoint pupils. This is because naloxone binds to the same receptors as opioids, but in a reversible manner. As a result, the patient's pupils will become very small and constricted, indicating that the reversal agent is working.\n\n", "output2": "Administering the reversal agent will cause the symptoms of opioid overdose to subside, resulting in smooth skin. This is a common side effect of the reversal agent.\n\n", "output3": "Tremulousness is a common side effect of administering a reversal agent for opioid overdose. This medication works by blocking the effects of opioids on the body, which can cause a range of symptoms, including tremors and shaking.\n\n"}, {"question": "A patient comes with episodic sudden severe sense of rotation associated with nausea on turning in bed.
