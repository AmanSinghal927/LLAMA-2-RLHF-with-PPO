It is responsible for the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is an essential cofactor for the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). During high-intensity exercise, serum lactate levels increase, providing a source of energy for the muscles.

During high-intensity exercise, such as a 1000-meter sprint, the body relies heavily on glycolysis to provide energy. As a result, the activity of PFK-1 increases significantly to meet the increased demand for glucose breakdown. The increase in serum lactate levels after the sprint is a result of the increased activity of PFK-1 and the subsequent production of lactate as a byproduct of glycolysis.
