This receptor is a co-receptor that HIV uses to enter T-cells. When the CXCR4 receptor is mutated, HIV is unable to bind to it, and therefore cannot enter the T-cells, making the individual resistant to HIV infection.\n\n", "output1": "People with a mutation of the CCR5 receptor are resistant to HIV infection. This mutation is known as the delta 32 mutation and is found in approximately 10% of people of European descent.\n\n", "output2": "People with a mutation of the chemokine receptor CXCR13 are resistant to HIV infection. This mutation prevents the virus from entering the cells and replicating.\n\n", "output3": "People with a mutation of the CCR2 chemokine receptor are resistant to infection by HIV. This is because CCR2 is one of the main co-receptors that HIV uses to enter CD4+ T cells. If a person has a mutation in the CCR2 gene, they will not be able to express the receptor on their CD4+ T cells, making it more difficult for HIV to infect them.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following relationships between ion concentrations in normal human plasma is correct ?:", "correct_answer": "Chloride> Bicarbonate.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Sodium <Potassium", "B)Chloride> Sodium.", "C)Bicarbonate <Calcium.", "D)Chloride> Bicarbonate."], "prompt": "Which of the following relationships between ion concentrations in normal human plasma is correct ?:A)Sodium <Potassium\nB)Chloride> Sodium.\nC)Bicarbonate <Calcium.\nD)Chloride> Bicarbonate.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "The normal concentration of sodium in human plasma is lower than that of potassium.
