Naloxone is an antidote to opioid overdose and is not indicated for diarrhea or muscle cramps. Alvimopan is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that is used to treat constipation, but it may not be effective for diarrhea.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which  of  the  following  is  not  a  branch  of third part of maxillary artery:", "correct_answer": "Supraorbital artery", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Supraorbital artery", "B)Infraorbital", "C)Sphenopalatine", "D)Lesser palatine"], "prompt": "Which  of  the  following  is  not  a  branch  of third part of maxillary artery:A)Supraorbital artery\nB)Infraorbital\nC)Sphenopalatine\nD)Lesser palatine", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "output0": "The supraorbital artery is not a branch of the third part of the maxillary artery.
