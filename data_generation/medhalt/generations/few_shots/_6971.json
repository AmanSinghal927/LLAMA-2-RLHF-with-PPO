This is an important step in the humoral response, as it helps to ensure that the T lymphocytes are properly activated and able to recognize and respond to the antigen.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is that activated B lymphocytes migrate to the follicle following a gradient of IL-2. This is because the production of IL-2 is increased in response to antigen stimulation, which leads to the activation and proliferation of B lymphocytes.\n\n", "output2": "The Turtle Technique is primarily indicated for older children, specifically those in the last courses of Primary Education. This approach is often used to help children in this age group develop better self-control and emotional regulation skills.\n\n", "output3": "B lymphocytes play a crucial role in the humoral response by processing and presenting antigens to T lymphocytes.
