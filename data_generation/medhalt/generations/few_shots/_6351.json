Bradykinin is a peptide hormone that is produced by the body and causes blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood flow and swelling. ACE inhibitors block the action of bradykinin, which can cause coughing as a side effect. However, the other adverse effects listed (angioedema, hypotension) are due to the effects of bradykinin.\n\n", "output1": "Angiodema is not an adverse effect of ACE inhibitors due to bradykinin. Angiodema is caused by the release of histamine and is not directly related to bradykinin.\n\n", "output2": "The adverse effect of ACE inhibitors due to bradykinin is angioedema, which is not hypotension. Hypotension is a side effect of ACE inhibitors, but it is not directly related to bradykinin.\n\n", "output3": "The adverse effect of ACE inhibitors that is not due to bradykinin is hypotension. Bradykinin is a peptide that is produced in response to ACE inhibition and causes blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood pressure.
