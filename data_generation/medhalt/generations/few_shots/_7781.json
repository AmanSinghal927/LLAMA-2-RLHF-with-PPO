Following a fatty meal, the level of chylomicrons (a type of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein) increases. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is the major form of cholesterol transport in the blood, and it is also involved in the reverse cholesterol transport, which helps to remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transport it to the liver for excretion. Therefore, in a patient with lipoprotein lipase deficiency, the level of HDL is increased following a fatty meal.\n\n", "output3": "In a patient with lipoprotein lipase deficiency, the level of Apo-A, a protein component of HDL, is increased following a fatty meal. This is because the body cannot break down the fat properly and so it is carried in the bloodstream as Apo-A.\n\n"}, {"question": "Submandibular calculus can be removed by:", "correct_answer": "Incision of the duct and removal of calculus", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Dilatation of the duct", "B)Excision of the opening of duct", "C)Removal of the gland", "D)Incision of the duct and removal of calculus"], "prompt": "Submandibular calculus can be removed by:A)Dilatation of the duct\nB)Excision of the opening of duct\nC)Removal of the gland\nD)Incision of the duct and removal of calculus", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "The correct answer is A)Dilatation of the duct.
