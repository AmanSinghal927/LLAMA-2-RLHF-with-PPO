The patient's symptoms of increasingly severe exertional dyspnea and the results of the blood cell inspection (including low RBC, HB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and WBC) suggest that the patient may have a condition that affects the production or function of red blood cells.

The patient's symptoms of increasingly severe dyspnea (exertional dyspnea) are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The laboratory results show that the patient has low levels of RBC, HB, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC, which are all indicative of iron deficiency anemia.
