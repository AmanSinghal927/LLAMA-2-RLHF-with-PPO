Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating sleep, attention, and mood. The patient's history of worrying and her inability to turn off her thoughts at night suggest that her acetylcholine levels may be depleted.\n\n", "output1": "Dopamine is the neurotransmitter most likely to be decreased in this patient. Dopamine is involved in the regulation of motivation, reward, and pleasure, and decreased dopamine levels are associated with anxiety and insomnia. The patient's difficulty falling asleep and her constant worrying, which is often accompanied by a racing heart, are consistent with a decrease in dopamine levels. Additionally, the patient's trouble concentrating at work is also consistent with decreased dopamine levels.\n\n", "output2": "GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating the activity of neurons in the brain. It has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system, which means that it helps to calm down or slow down the activity of neurons. In patients with anxiety disorders, such as the one described by the patient, GABA levels are often decreased. This can lead to an increase in the activity of neurons, resulting in symptoms such as difficulty sleeping, racing thoughts, and difficulty concentrating.\n\n", "output3": "Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating the body's \"fight or flight\" response. The symptoms described by the patient, such as difficulty sleeping, racing heart, and difficulty concentrating, are all indicative of a decreased level of norepinephrine. Additionally, the content of the patient's worry (e.g. concerns about her child's well-being) is consistent with the type of stress-related anxiety that can be associated with decreased norepinephrine levels.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is beta-Lactam antibiotic?", "correct_answer": "Cephalosporins", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Sulphonamide", "B)Carbamide", "C)Cephalosporins", "D)Ofloxacin"], "prompt": "Which of the following is beta-Lactam antibiotic?A)Sulphonamide\nB)Carbamide\nC)Cephalosporins\nD)Ofloxacin", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "Sulphonamides are beta-lactam antibiotics, which are a class of antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacteria.
