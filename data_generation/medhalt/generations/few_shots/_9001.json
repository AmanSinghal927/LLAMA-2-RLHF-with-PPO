Exposure to high levels of lead during pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and other complications. In addition, lead exposure has been linked to fertility problems and may cause sterility in females.\n\n", "output1": "Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that can cause sterility in females by damaging the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide can lead to infertility and miscarriage.\n\n", "output2": "Mercury is a known teratogen, which means that it can cause birth defects and reproductive problems. Exposure to high levels of mercury can cause sterility in females, as well as other reproductive and developmental problems.\n\n", "output3": "Exposure to certain agricultural insecticides, such as DDT, has been linked to an increased risk of sterility in females. These chemicals can interfere with the normal functioning of the reproductive system and can cause hormonal imbalances that lead to infertility.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following change can be done in insulin structure so that there is least change in the function of insulin:", "correct_answer": "Interchange of B29 and B30", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Interchange of A1 & A4", "B)Interchange of B29 and B30", "C)Interchange of A5 & A6", "D)Breaking disulphide linkages"], "prompt": "Which of the following change can be done in insulin structure so that there is least change in the function of insulin:A)Interchange of A1 & A4\nB)Interchange of B29 and B30\nC)Interchange of A5 & A6\nD)Breaking disulphide linkages", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "output0": "The interchange of A1 and A4 amino acids in insulin would have the least effect on the function of insulin. This is because these two amino acids are not involved in the active site of the enzyme, and therefore, their interchange would not significantly affect the binding of insulin to its receptor or the catalytic activity of the enzyme.\n\n", "output1": "Interchanging B29 and B30 in the insulin structure would have the least impact on the function of insulin. This is because these two residues are not directly involved in the binding of insulin to its receptor, and therefore any changes made to them would not significantly affect the overall function of the hormone.\n\n", "output2": "This change would have the least impact on the function of insulin because A5 and A6 are not critical for insulin's structure or function. In fact, the A5 and A6 residues are not even present in the human insulin molecule.\n\n", "output3": "The structure of insulin is very stable and any change in the structure can affect its function. However, breaking disulphide linkages does not affect the function of insulin significantly.
