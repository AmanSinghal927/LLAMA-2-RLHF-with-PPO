This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA.

Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms.
