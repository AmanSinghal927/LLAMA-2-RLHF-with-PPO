In the case of a pregnant female with known cardiac disease and a history of warfarin embryopathy, it is important to carefully monitor the patient's INR and adjust the dosage as needed to prevent bleeding or thrombosis.\n\n", "output1": "Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that can cause embryopathy, a condition that can lead to birth defects and developmental delays. It is recommended to replace warfarin with heparin in the first trimester of pregnancy to minimize the risk of embryopathy. Heparin is a less toxic and more effective alternative to warfarin during pregnancy.\n\n", "output2": "For pregnant women with known cardiac disease and a history of warfarin embryopathy, acicoumarin is the recommended anticoagulant in the first trimester. This is because warfarin can cause fetal malformations and death, and heparin may not be effective in preventing thrombosis. Acicoumarin, on the other hand, has a low risk of fetal malformations and is effective in preventing thrombosis.\n\n", "output3": "Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is a safer option than warfarin for pregnant women with a history of warfarin embryopathy. LMWH has a lower risk of teratogenicity and bleeding complications compared to warfarin. Additionally, LMWH has a more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile, making it easier to monitor and manage.\n\n"}, {"question": "In which of the following conditions would maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values be the highest:", "correct_answer": "Gastroschisis", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Down's syndrome", "B)Omphalocele", "C)Gastroschisis", "D)Spina bifida occulta"], "prompt": "In which of the following conditions would maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values be the highest:A)Down's syndrome\nB)Omphalocele\nC)Gastroschisis\nD)Spina bifida occulta", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) values are typically highest in cases of Down's syndrome, as the condition is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications and abnormalities.\n\n", "output1": "Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values are typically the highest in cases of omphalocele, a condition in which the intestines protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall.

This deficiency can occur as a side effect of the anti-tuberculosis medication, isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits the enzyme homocysteine degradation, leading to a build-up of homocysteine in the body. Elevated homocysteine levels can cause a number of symptoms, including the ones mentioned.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet are most likely caused by increased GABA production.
