This is because the sympathetic nervous system, which is activated during times of stress or anxiety, causes the release of norepinephrine, which inhibits the release of renin.\n\n", "output1": "Prostacyclin, also known as prostaglandin I2, is a hormone that is produced by the endothelium of blood vessels and acts as a vasodilator. It inhibits the secretion of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Therefore, prostacyclin decreases renin secretion.\n\n", "output2": "Renin secretion is decreased by the presence of NaCl in distal tubules. This is because NaCl inhibits the secretion of renin, a hormone that regulates blood pressure.\n\n", "output3": "Renin secretion is decreased by hypotension, which is a decrease in blood pressure. When the blood pressure drops, the kidneys release renin to help raise the blood pressure back to normal levels.\n\n"}, {"question": "Dose of dexamethasone given to mother in anticipated preterm delivery:", "correct_answer": "6 mg 12 hourly 4 doses", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)12 mg 12 hourly 2 doses", "B)12 mg 24 hourly 4 doses", "C)6 mg 24 hourly 2 doses", "D)6 mg 12 hourly 4 doses"], "prompt": "Dose of dexamethasone given to mother in anticipated preterm delivery:A)12 mg 12 hourly 2 doses\nB)12 mg 24 hourly 4 doses\nC)6 mg 24 hourly 2 doses\nD)6 mg 12 hourly 4 doses", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The recommended dose of dexamethasone for anticipated preterm delivery is 12 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses.
