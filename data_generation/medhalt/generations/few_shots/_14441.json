The outbreak was due to the transmission of the hepatitis virus through the use of contaminated needles, which led to a large number of cases and fatalities.\n\n", "output1": "The 1955 Hepatitis outbreak in Delhi was a major outbreak that occurred in India in 1955. The outbreak was caused by a strain of Hepatitis A virus, which was transmitted through contaminated food and water. The outbreak resulted in a large number of cases and deaths, and it was a major public health concern at the time.\n\n", "output2": "The 1955 Hepatitis outbreak in Delhi was caused by a contaminated polio vaccine.\n\n", "output3": "The 1955 Hepatitis outbreak in Delhi was caused by a contaminated polio vaccine, which was distributed to millions of children in India. The outbreak was a major public health crisis and led to the deaths of many children. The incident highlighted the importance of vaccine safety and the need for strict quality control measures in the manufacture and distribution of vaccines.\n\n"}, {"question": "The region of the cerebral cortex that selects the most appropriate strategy to execute a movement based on experience and makes the decision to initiate the movement is:", "correct_answer": "The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)The primary motor area.", "B)The ventromedial prefrontal cortex.", "C)The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.", "D)The inferotemporal cortex."], "prompt": "The region of the cerebral cortex that selects the most appropriate strategy to execute a movement based on experience and makes the decision to initiate the movement is:A)The primary motor area.\nB)The ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\nC)The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nD)The inferotemporal cortex.", "subject_name": "psychology", "output0": "The primary motor area is the region of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for selecting the most appropriate strategy to execute a movement based on experience and making the decision to initiate the movement.\n\n", "output1": "The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is responsible for the selection and initiation of movements based on experience and cognitive information.

This occurs when the left ventricular pressure becomes elevated and the mitral valve is pushed into the aortic valve, causing blood to flow backward from the aorta into the left ventricle. This can be seen on an autopsy photograph of sections of the heart.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's history of cardiac arrest and the fact that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted for 10 minutes without success are both indicative of a catastrophic event that led to the patient's death. The most likely cause of this event is a fixed obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, which would have prevented blood from flowing out of the left ventricle and led to cardiac arrest.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's condition is most likely associated with marked noncompliance of the left ventricular wall, which is characterized by a lack of elastic recoil and increased stiffness of the left ventricular myocardium. This can lead to impaired relaxation and reduced filling of the left ventricle, resulting in decreased cardiac output and eventual collapse.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's condition is most likely associated with severe narrowing of the left anterior descending artery, which is the main artery that supplies blood to the left ventricle. This blockage would have caused the patient's heart to become starved of oxygen and nutrients, leading to the collapse and death.\n\n"}, {"question": "Absolute refractoriness of a neuron is due to?", "correct_answer": "Closure of inactivated Na channels", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Closure of activated Na channels", "B)Closure of inactivated Na channels", "C)Hyperpolarization of CI channels", "D)Opening of rectifier K + channels"], "prompt": "Absolute refractoriness of a neuron is due to?A)Closure of activated Na channels\nB)Closure of inactivated Na channels\nC)Hyperpolarization of CI channels\nD)Opening of rectifier K + channels", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "Absolute refractoriness is due to the closure of activated Na channels, which prevents the flow of Na ions into the neuron. This closure is caused by the inactivation of the Na channels, which occurs when the membrane potential of the neuron becomes more negative.\n\n", "output1": "Absolute refractoriness is due to the closure of inactivated Na channels. This means that even though the neuron is not firing, it is still unable to fire because the Na channels are closed and cannot be activated again.\n\n", "output2": "Absolute refractoriness is due to the hyperpolarization of the CI channels, which prevents the neuron from generating an action potential even if the membrane potential is depolarized.\n\n", "output3": "Absolute refractoriness is due to the opening of rectifier K + channels, which prevents the neuron from firing again for a short period of time. This is a result of the depolarization of the neuron's membrane potential, which causes the K + channels to open and allow K + ions to leave the cell, making it more negative and refractory.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 32 years old female came for routine PAP smear testing.

This is because CIS is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV-DNA testing can help determine the presence of the virus and guide further management.\n\n", "output1": "Hysterectomy is the next step in the treatment of cervical carcinoma in situ. This is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus and is often recommended as the first step in the management of this condition.\n\n", "output2": "The next step for a 32-year-old female with a diagnosis of carcinoma in situ (CIS) after a routine PAP smear is conization. This is a minimally invasive procedure that involves removing the abnormal cells from the cervix. HPV-DNA testing (A) and hysterectomy (B) are not necessary for this diagnosis. Colposcopy and biopsy (D) may be performed in the future if further evaluation is needed.\n\n", "output3": "Colposcopy and biopsy are the next steps in the management of a patient with a diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which is the most common form of cervical precancer. HPV-DNA testing may also be performed to determine if the patient has HPV infection, which can be a risk factor for the development of cervical cancer.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 38-year-old man with a history of type 1 diabetes consulted for a picture of 3-4 months of mechanical pain without a traumatic history referring to the inguinal area and anterior aspect of both thighs.

Therefore, a MRI study of both hips would be indicated to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the lesion.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's symptoms of mechanical pain in the inguinal area and anterior aspect of both thighs, as well as the limited internal rotation of the left hip, suggest a diagnosis of transient osteoporosis. This condition is characterized by the sudden and temporary weakening of the bone, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, infection, or metabolic disorders. The patient's age and history of type 1 diabetes also support this diagnosis. The radiological study shows a radiolucent subchondral image in the left hip, which is consistent with transient osteoporosis.
