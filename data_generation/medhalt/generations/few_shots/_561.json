When prolactin is secreted, it can help to reduce the secretion of prolactin in the next cycle.\n\n", "output1": "When the hypothalamus receives a signal to reduce the secretion of prolactin, it can cause the next secretion of prolactin to be higher. This is because adrenaline (epinephrine) is released in response to the hypothalamus' signal, and this hormone can stimulate the pituitary gland to release more prolactin.\n\n", "output2": "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the regulation of prolactin secretion. When the hypothalamus receives dopamine signals, it can reduce the secretion of prolactin. This can cause the next secretion of prolactin to be higher than usual.\n\n", "output3": "When the hypothalamus reduces the secretion of prolactin, it can cause the next secretion of prolactin. This is because serotonin, which is produced by the hypothalamus, inhibits the secretion of prolactin. So, if the hypothalamus reduces the secretion of serotonin, it can lead to an increase in prolactin secretion.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 39-year-old African-American woman presents to the emergency room with hip pain.
