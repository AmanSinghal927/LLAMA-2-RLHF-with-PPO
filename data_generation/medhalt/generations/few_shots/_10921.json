This system is widely used and accepted by the medical community, and it provides a standardized framework for evaluating the extent of the disease.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)In a postmenopausal patient with a complex pelvic mass, surgical exploration with laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy becomes necessary, regardless of the CT findings. This is because the CT findings may not always be accurate in detecting the extent of the disease, especially in postmenopausal patients. Therefore, surgical exploration is necessary to accurately assess the extent of the disease and determine the appropriate treatment.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)The absence of pathological enlargement of the pelvic and / or para-aortic ganglia size by CT avoids lymphadenectomy and its anatomopathological study. This is because the size of the pelvic and para-aortic ganglia is not a reliable indicator of the presence of metastatic disease in ovarian cancer. Therefore, relying solely on CT imaging to determine the extent of the disease and the need for lymphadenectomy may not be accurate.\n\n", "output3": "Ultrasound examination has a higher sensitivity than CT for the detection of peritoneal metastases in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer because it can detect smaller lesions and can visualize the peritoneal surface more clearly.\n\n"}, {"question": "A typical normalized score equal to zero, leaves below itself:", "correct_answer": "50% of cases.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)0% of cases.", "B)50% of cases.", "C)100% of cases.", "D)25% of the cases."], "prompt": "A typical normalized score equal to zero, leaves below itself:A)0% of cases.\nB)50% of cases.\nC)100% of cases.\nD)25% of the cases.", "subject_name": "psychology", "output0": "A typical normalized score of zero indicates that the child has not exhibited any problematic behavior. Therefore, 0% of cases would be the correct answer.\n\n", "output1": "When a typical normalized score is equal to zero, it means that the child has a 50% chance of exhibiting the target behavior. This is because the Turtle Technique is designed to gradually increase the amount of time the child spends in the target behavior, with the goal of eventually achieving 100% compliance. However, at the beginning of the intervention, the child may not be able to maintain the target behavior for the full duration of the intervention, so the normalized score may be lower than 100%.\n\n", "output2": "When a typical normalized score is equal to zero, it means that the child is performing at the average level for their age group.

Therefore, the next step in management is to do nothing and monitor the child's condition for any recurrences.\n\n", "output1": "Ultrasound is the next step in the management of a 2-year-old female with a urinary tract infection (UTI). This is because ultrasound can help identify any anatomical abnormalities that may be contributing to the UTI, such as a urinary tract obstruction or a malformed kidney. Additionally, ultrasound can help determine the severity of the infection and monitor the response to treatment.\n\n", "output2": "The next step in management for a 2-year-old girl who has been successfully treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) is to perform an ultrasound and DMSA scan. This is because UTIs in young children can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a congenital anomaly or reflux, and these tests can help identify any underlying issues. Additionally, DMSA scans can help assess the kidneys' function and identify any potential damage.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)6 monthly culture sensitivity because, after successful treatment of a urinary tract infection, it is important to monitor the child's urinary tract health to prevent future infections.
