Estradiol is the primary female sex hormone, and its levels decrease during menopause. A level of estradiol less than 20 pg/ml is typically used to diagnose menopause.\n\n", "output1": "The diagnosis of menopause is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. One of the key laboratory tests is the measurement of progesterone levels. A progesterone level <40 ng/dl is considered a diagnostic marker of menopause.\n\n", "output2": "Menopause is diagnosed based on the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the blood. When the ovaries stop producing eggs, FSH levels increase. A level of FSH greater than 40 IU/L is considered diagnostic of menopause.\n\n", "output3": "Menopause is typically diagnosed based on the presence of symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, as well as changes in menstrual patterns. One of the most common markers of menopause is an elevated level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. An FSH level above 40 IU/L is often considered a diagnostic marker of menopause.\n\n"}, {"question": "55-year-old male patient work in the plastics factory for 25 years, due to weight loss, and nausea and vomiting more than three months and treatment.
