This is because liver cancer screening typically involves measuring liver function tests, such as alkaline phosphatase, and performing abdominal ultrasound to detect any abnormalities in the liver.\n\n", "output1": "Fetoprotein and abdominal ultrasound are the best screening tools for liver cancer. Fetoprotein is a protein produced by the liver and its level in the blood can be used to detect liver cancer. Abdominal ultrasound can also help detect liver cancer by visualizing the liver and detecting any abnormalities.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound. Bilirubin is a substance produced by the liver that can be elevated in the blood of individuals with liver disease. Abdominal ultrasound is also a useful tool for detecting liver cancer.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Amino acid amino transferase \ue2c6 (alanine aminotransferase, ALT), abdominal ultrasound. This combination of tests is used to screen for liver cancer in high-risk populations, such as those with hepatitis B or C infection.
