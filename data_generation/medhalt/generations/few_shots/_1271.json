This is because the plasma membrane is the only membrane in the cell that is in contact with the extracellular environment.\n\n", "output1": "Glucose is a larger molecule than water, and it is more difficult for it to pass through the plasma membrane. However, glucose has a higher concentration gradient than water, which means that it is more concentrated on the outside of the cell than on the inside. This concentration gradient drives the transport of glucose through the plasma membrane.\n\n", "output2": "The transport of ions through biological membranes is not possible because the membranes are impermeable to ions. This means that ions cannot pass through the membrane, and therefore, the ions cannot be transported.\n\n", "output3": "Transport through biological membranes can consume ATP, depending on the type of transport mechanism being used. For example, active transport, which involves the movement of substances across the membrane using energy from ATP, can consume ATP. Passive transport, on the other hand, does not require ATP and is driven by concentration gradients.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 55-year-old obese man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain.
