This is why the permeability of the glomerular capillaries is the correct answer.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Hydrostatic pressure. Renal filtration of H2O occurs in the glomerular capillaries and their reabsorption in the peritubular because the former have greater hydrostatic pressure.\n\n", "output2": "The colloidosmotic pressure is the pressure exerted by the fluid in the glomerular capillaries on the glomerular epithelium, which is responsible for the reabsorption of water and solutes. The colloidosmotic pressure is greater in the peritubular capillaries than in the glomerular capillaries, which allows for the reabsorption of water and solutes from the filtrate.\n\n", "output3": "Renal filtration of water occurs in the glomerular capillaries and their reabsorption in the peritubular because the former have greater diameter. This is because the glomerular capillaries have a larger diameter than the peritubular capillaries, which allows for more water to be filtered and reabsorbed.\n\n"}, {"question": "In BSSO setback, fixation in neutral posterior zone is best achieved with:", "correct_answer": "Lag screw", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Lag screw", "B)Position screw", "C)Miniplate", "D)No fixation is required in neutral position"], "prompt": "In BSSO setback, fixation in neutral posterior zone is best achieved with:A)Lag screw\nB)Position screw\nC)Miniplate\nD)No fixation is required in neutral position", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "The Lag screw is the most effective type of fixation for achieving neutral position in BSSO setback. It allows for a more precise and stable reduction of the fracture, and can be used to maintain the correction in the neutral position.\n\n", "output1": "Position screws are the most commonly used fixation method for achieving fixation in the neutral position in BSSO setback. This is because position screws are designed to maintain the bone in a neutral position, rather than pushing it into a fixed position.\n\n", "output2": "In BSSO setback, fixation in the neutral posterior zone is best achieved with a miniplate. This is because the miniplate is a smaller and more flexible fixation device that can be positioned in the posterior elements of the spine without compromising the neutral position.\n\n", "output3": "In BSSO setback, fixation in the neutral posterior zone is not required. The goal of the procedure is to restore the normal anatomical position of the bone, and fixation in the neutral position can hinder this goal.
