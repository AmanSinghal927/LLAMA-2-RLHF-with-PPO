This is because the patient has refractory heart failure, complete atrioventricular block, and aortic valve regurgitation with a small effective orifice area, which are all indications for surgical intervention. Additionally, the presence of Streptococcus gallolyticus in serial cultures suggests that the patient has infective endocarditis, which is a condition that requires prompt surgical treatment.\n\n", "output1": "The patient presents with heart failure symptoms and a complete atrioventricular block.

The patient also has a fever and a positive culture for Streptococcus gallolyticus, which suggests an infectious etiology.\n\n", "output2": "The best attitude in this case is C)Implantation of transient pacemaker, antibiotic therapy according to antibiogram and percutaneous implantation of aortic valve prosthesis. This approach is indicated because the patient has a severe aortic regurgitation and heart failure, and the signs of heart failure are refractory to medical treatment. Additionally, the patient has a bacterial endocarditis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus, which requires urgent treatment. The transient pacemaker will help control the patient's heart rate and rhythm, while the antibiotic therapy will help treat the bacterial infection. The percutaneous implantation of aortic valve prosthesis will help improve the patient's aortic regurgitation.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's symptoms of heart failure are refractory to medical treatment, and the echocardiography shows an aortic valve with an effective regurgitant orifice of 0.5 cm2, which is a clear indication for aortic valve replacement.
