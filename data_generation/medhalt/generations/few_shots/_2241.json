This is because the prematurity is related to the vertical dimension of the bite, and the mesiodistal position of the teeth is the most effective way to address this issue.\n\n", "output2": "When there is a prematurity in centric occlusion, but not in eccentric or other movements, it is likely that the opposing fassa or marginal ridge is reduced. This is because the opposing fassa or marginal ridge is the area of maximum contact between the teeth during centric occlusion, and a prematurity in this area can cause a reduction in the height of the opposing fassa or marginal ridge.\n\n", "output3": "When there is a prematurity in centric occlusion, it means that the teeth are not fully developed and are not in their proper position. This can affect the alignment of the teeth, but it does not necessarily result in a reduction of the cusps of opposing teeth, the mesiodistal position of teeth, or the opposing fassa or marginal ridge.
