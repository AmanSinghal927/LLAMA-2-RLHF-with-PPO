The fact that she has started restricting her diet and avoiding certain activities because of her symptoms also supports this diagnosis.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's presentation is consistent with a factitious disorder, which is a condition in which an individual intentionally produces or exaggerates symptoms in order to gain attention or sympathy. The patient's refusal to leave the emergency department until she is told what is causing her symptoms, her reluctance to undergo further testing, and her restrictive diet and avoidance of eating lunch are all consistent with a factitious disorder. Additionally, the patient's statement that she feels as if the nausea is worse when she is trying to work suggests that she may be exacerbating her symptoms in order to avoid work-related responsibilities.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's presentation is consistent with malingering. Malingering is the intentional production of symptoms in order to gain attention or avoid undesirable situations. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with any known medical condition, and her reluctance to leave the emergency department despite multiple workups and normal test results suggests that she may be exaggerating her symptoms in order to gain attention or avoid going back to work. Additionally, her restrictive diet and avoidance of eating lunch are also indicative of malingering.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's symptoms of nausea and diarrhea, as well as her avoidance behaviors and restrictive diet, are consistent with a somatic symptom disorder. Additionally, the patient's desire to continue working despite her symptoms and her reluctance to leave the emergency department suggest that she is experiencing significant distress and impairment in her daily life. The patient's history of multiple workups and imaging studies, as well as her belief that her symptoms are caused by her job, also support a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder.\n\n"}, {"question": "33 yr old female presents with a slow growing bony mass along the distal femur coex in the metaphyseal region with an appreciable gap between the coex and tumor without any coical invasion.
