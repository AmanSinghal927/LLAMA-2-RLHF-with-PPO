This is because the root canal treatment removes the pulp tissue, which is a major source of resorption.\n\n", "output1": "In an endodontically treated tooth, the resorption rate is typically higher than in a normal tooth. This is because the root canal treatment can lead to inflammation and bone loss, which can cause the tooth to become shorter over time.\n\n", "output2": "The rate of resorption in an endodontically treated tooth is the same as in a normal tooth. Endodontic treatment does not alter the rate of resorption.\n\n", "output3": "Resorption is a normal process in which the tooth roots are resorbed by the surrounding bone after endodontic treatment. In an endodontically treated tooth, the rate of resorption is not significantly different from a normal tooth.
