This increase in width is a compensatory mechanism to help maintain the health and stability of the tooth-supporting bone.\n\n", "output1": "Excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits will decrease the width of the period of dental development (PDL). This is because the teeth are being subjected to forces that are beyond their capacity to withstand, which can cause them to become displaced or resorbed.\n\n", "output2": "Excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits will not significantly change the width of the PDL. The PDL is a relatively rigid structure that is designed to withstand forces within certain limits. While excessive forces may cause discomfort or pain, they will not cause the PDL to expand or contract significantly.\n\n", "output3": "Excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits can cause trauma to the teeth and surrounding tissues. This can result in a decrease in the width of the periodontal ligament (PDL) and potentially lead to tooth loss.\n\n"}, {"question": "Thick pasty saliva is due to:", "correct_answer": "Reflex sympathetic stimulation.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Reflex sympathetic stimulation.", "B)Parasympathetic stimulation.", "C)Both.", "D)None."], "prompt": "Thick pasty saliva is due to:A)Reflex sympathetic stimulation.\nB)Parasympathetic stimulation.\nC)Both.\nD)None.", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Reflex sympathetic stimulation is a common cause of thick, pasty saliva in children.

The mucosa of the cheek is thin and non-keratinized, meaning it does not contain the tough, protective protein keratin that is found in the skin. The skin, on the other hand, is thicker and contains a layer of keratinized cells that help protect it from the environment.\n\n", "output1": "The keratinized mucosa of the cheek is different from the skin because it is covered with a layer of dead skin cells that are shed regularly, whereas the skin is covered with a layer of dead skin cells that are not shed as frequently. Additionally, the mucosa of the cheek is thicker than the skin and has a different type of glands.\n\n", "output2": "The main difference between the skin and mucosa of the cheek is the presence of rete pegs on the mucosa. Rete pegs are small projections that extend from the epithelial layer of the mucosa into the subepithelial tissue, and they play a role in maintaining the integrity of the mucosa. The skin of the cheek does not have rete pegs.\n\n", "output3": "The skin and mucosa of the cheek are two different types of tissues that have distinct differences. The skin of the cheek is characterized by a thick lamina propria, which is a layer of connective tissue that provides support and structure to the skin. In contrast, the mucosa of the cheek is a thin layer of epithelial tissue that lines the mouth and is responsible for the secretion of mucus.\n\n"}, {"question": "Insulin stimulated glucose uptake is by?", "correct_answer": "GLUT-4", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)SGLT-1", "B)GLUT-1", "C)GLUT-2", "D)GLUT-4"], "prompt": "Insulin stimulated glucose uptake is by?A)SGLT-1\nB)GLUT-1\nC)GLUT-2\nD)GLUT-4", "subject_name": "Unknown", "output0": "Insulin stimulated glucose uptake is primarily mediated by SGLT-1, which is a sodium-glucose cotransporter found in the liver and skeletal muscles.\n\n", "output1": "Insulin stimulated glucose uptake is mediated by GLUT-1, which is a glucose transporter found in the plasma membrane of cells.
