This medication is applied to the scalp and left on for 10-15 minutes before being rinsed off. A second application is usually done 7-10 days later to kill any newly hatched lice. Lindano is another medication that is effective against head lice, but it is not as commonly used as permethrin.\n\n", "output2": "Acetic acid lotion is the treatment of choice for head lice infestation, as it is effective in killing both the lice and the nits (eggs). It is also safe for use on children, and can be applied daily for 7 days.
