The CDJ is a distinct anatomical feature that is easily identifiable and provides a clear indication of the completion of the endodontic treatment.\n\n", "output1": "The apical foramen is a landmark that indicates the completion of cleaning, shaping, and obturation in root canal treatment. It marks the boundary between the root canal and the apical portion of the tooth, and its presence is a sign that the root canal has been properly cleaned and shaped.\n\n", "output2": "Apical constriction is a landmark that is used to determine when the cleaning, shaping, and obturation of the root canal system is complete. It is located at the apical foramen, the point where the root canal opens into the pulp chamber.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)All of the above.

In the case of the mandibular condyle, a green stick fracture is typically treated with open reduction and fixation.\n\n", "output3": "Open reduction and fixation of fracture of mandibular condyle is indicated when the fracture is not dislocated.

As a result, they are more easily penetrated by X-rays, allowing for better visualization of these structures.\n\n", "output1": "Nerve and muscle tissue are the most sensitive to X-rays because they contain the highest concentration of water molecules, which are the primary targets of X-rays. This means that X-rays are most effective at penetrating and interacting with nerve and muscle tissue.\n\n", "output2": "Hair and nails are the most sensitive to X-rays because they are made of the same tissue as bone, which is very dense and absorbs X-rays well.\n\n", "output3": "Cartilage is the most sensitive to X-rays because it has the lowest density and contains the least amount of calcium, making it more vulnerable to radiation damage.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a cause of neonatal anaemia?", "correct_answer": "Wilson's Disease", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Subgaleal Hemorrhage", "B)Abruptio placentae", "C)Diamond Blackfan syndeome", "D)Wilson's Disease"], "prompt": "Which of the following is not a cause of neonatal anaemia?A)Subgaleal Hemorrhage\nB)Abruptio placentae\nC)Diamond Blackfan syndeome\nD)Wilson's Disease", "subject_name": "Pediatrics", "output0": "Subgaleal Hemorrhage is not a cause of neonatal anemia.

This resistance can make it more difficult to treat infections caused by this fungus.\n\n", "output2": "Candida tropicalis is one of the Candida species that exhibits intrinsic resistance to fluconazole. This resistance is due to the presence of a mechanism that pumps the drug out of the cell, making it less effective against this species.\n\n", "output3": "Candida parapsilosis is one of the few species of Candida that exhibits intrinsic resistance to fluconazole.

This bias is likely to have been more pronounced in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group.\n\n", "output1": "The endpoint selected for the study, average survival time, is a measure of the length of time that patients survive after being diagnosed with GBM. The fact that the asymptomatic patients had a longer average survival time than the symptomatic patients is likely due to the length-time bias, which occurs when the measurement of the endpoint is influenced by the length of time that the patients have been under observation. In this case, the asymptomatic patients were under observation for a longer period of time before they were diagnosed, which likely resulted in a longer average survival time.\n\n", "output2": "The endpoint selected for the study, which was the time from diagnosis to death, is susceptible to surveillance bias. Since the asymptomatic patients were screened with MRI, they were more likely to be detected earlier and have a longer survival time, compared to the symptomatic patients who were only diagnosed after developing symptoms.
