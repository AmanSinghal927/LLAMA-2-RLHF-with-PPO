This is because diabetes during pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects, especially in the central nervous system. Amelia is a rare congenital abnormality that affects the development of the limb buds. It is often associated with maternal diabetes and can be detected on ultrasound.\n\n", "output1": "The most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound for a pregnant woman with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes is sacral agenesis, also known as sacral dysgenesis. This condition occurs when the sacrum does not develop properly, leading to a range of symptoms including low back pain, sciatica, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. The fundal height of 20 cm (7.9 in) is a significant predictor of this condition.\n\n", "output2": "The most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound for a pregnant woman with type 1 diabetes at 18 weeks gestation is spina bifida, which is a neural tube defect. This is because maternal diabetes during pregnancy increases the risk of spina bifida.\n\n", "output3": "The most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound is Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), which is a common congenital heart defect that is often associated with poor diabetic control during pregnancy.

Caffeine increases the activity of the corpus callosum, leading to improved communication between the two hemispheres and enhanced cognitive function.\n\n", "output2": "The principal central action of caffeine is on the hypothalamus, which is a part of the brain that regulates various physiological processes such as sleep, appetite, and body temperature. Caffeine can increase alertness and wakefulness by blocking the action of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate sleep, in the hypothalamus.\n\n", "output3": "Caffeine has a direct effect on the spinal cord, where it can block the action of certain neurotransmitters and increase the release of others.
