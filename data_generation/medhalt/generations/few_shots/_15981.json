When the body is exposed to cold water, the vagus nerve is stimulated, leading to a decrease in heart rate and potentially causing cardiac arrest.\n\n", "output1": "When a person drowns in cold water, the initial cause of death is usually asphyxia due to the lack of oxygen to the brain. As the body attempts to warm the water, the person may experience vagal inhibition, which can lead to loss of consciousness and eventually death from asphyxia.\n\n", "output2": "When a person drowns in cold water, the initial cause of death is often loss of consciousness due to hypoxia (lack of oxygen). This can lead to vagal inhibition, which can cause asphyxia and ultimately death.\n\n", "output3": "When a person is submerged in cold water, their body undergoes a series of physiological changes that can lead to death. One of the most common causes of death in cold water is ventricular fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat that can cause cardiac arrest. This can occur due to the sudden drop in body temperature, which can affect the heart's electrical activity.\n\n"}, {"question": "Sickle cell anemia is a -", "correct_answer": "Point mutation", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Gene deletion", "B)Gene modification", "C)Point mutation", "D)Frame shift mutation"], "prompt": "Sickle cell anemia is a -A)Gene deletion\nB)Gene modification\nC)Point mutation\nD)Frame shift mutation", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "output0": "Sickle cell anemia is caused by a deletion of the \u03b2-globin gene, which results in a point mutation that leads to the production of sickle hemoglobin.\n\n", "output1": "Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the HBB gene that codes for the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation results in the production of sickle hemoglobin, which is responsible for the characteristic anemia and other symptoms of the disease.\n\n", "output2": "The sickle cell anemia is a point mutation, specifically a substitution of the glutamic acid for the valine at position 6 of the hemoglobin beta chain.

This is a condition in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed, so that the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle.\n\n", "output1": "Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common conotruncal anomaly, accounting for approximately 70% of all conotruncal defects. It is a combination of four key defects, including a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and a thickened muscular wall in the ventricle.\n\n", "output2": "Truncus aeriosus is a conotruncal anomaly that is most commonly seen in children. It is a condition where the truncus arteriosus, which is the common trunk that carries oxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the rest of the body, does not properly divide into the pulmonary and systemic arteries. This can lead to a variety of complications, including cyanosis, shortness of breath, and heart failure.\n\n", "output3": "Double outlet right ventricle is the most common conotruncal anomaly.

When the liver is damaged, as in the case of cirrhosis, it can lead to an imbalance in blood flow and pressure, causing edema in the neck veins.\n\n", "output1": "Unilateral lower extremity edema is often caused by venous or lymphatic obstruction, which can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the affected limb. This type of edema is commonly seen in conditions such as deep vein thrombosis, lymphedema, and lipedema.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Blood proteins such as reduced nephrotic syndrome, without causing the face or eyelid edema. This is because edema caused by reduced nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the presence of proteinuria, or the loss of large amounts of protein in the urine. This can lead to swelling in the legs and other parts of the body, but it does not typically cause swelling in the face or eyelids.\n\n", "output3": "Typical edema caused by heart failure is largely unrelated and dependent sites. This is because the edema is caused by the failure of the heart to pump blood effectively, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body. This type of edema is not associated with any specific site or location, and it can affect the entire body.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following drugs is contraindicated in children and adolescents due to epidemiological association with Reye Syndrome ?:", "correct_answer": "Acetylsalicylic acid.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Acetylsalicylic acid.", "B)Paracetamol.", "C)Ibuprofen.", "D)Diclofenac"], "prompt": "Which of the following drugs is contraindicated in children and adolescents due to epidemiological association with Reye Syndrome ?:A)Acetylsalicylic acid.\nB)Paracetamol.\nC)Ibuprofen.\nD)Diclofenac", "subject_name": "nursery", "output0": "Acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated in children and adolescents due to an epidemiological association with Reye Syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.

Mineralocorticoids are hormones produced by the adrenal glands that help regulate electrolyte and water balance in the body. Triamcinolone has a high affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors, which makes it more effective at regulating electrolyte and water balance than other corticosteroids.\n\n"}, {"question": "Tubuloglomerular feedback is for regulation of?", "correct_answer": "GFR", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)BP", "B)Blood volume", "C)Na+ reabsorption", "D)GFR"], "prompt": "Tubuloglomerular feedback is for regulation of?A)BP\nB)Blood volume\nC)Na+ reabsorption\nD)GFR", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "Tubuloglomerular feedback is a mechanism that helps regulate blood pressure (BP) by adjusting the amount of sodium (Na+) that is reabsorbed by the kidneys. When BP is high, the tubules in the kidneys receive signals to increase the amount of Na+ that is reabsorbed, which helps to lower BP.\n\n", "output1": "Tubuloglomerular feedback is a mechanism that helps regulate blood volume. It works by sending signals from the tubules to the glomeruli, which then adjust the amount of filtrate that is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream.

This process is important for maintaining proper fluid balance and blood pressure.\n\n", "output3": "Tubuloglomerular feedback is a type of negative feedback mechanism that regulates glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The mechanism is based on the fact that the tubules receive a constant amount of blood flow, and the glomeruli receive a constant amount of filtrate. If the filtrate is too concentrated, the tubules will reabsorb more water and dilute the filtrate, which in turn will decrease the amount of filtrate that reaches the glomeruli. This decrease in filtrate will cause a decrease in GFR.\n\n"}, {"question": "Initial calcification of crown represents Which Nolla's stage:", "correct_answer": "Stage 2", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Stage 1", "B)Stage 2", "C)Stage 3", "D)Stage 4"], "prompt": "Initial calcification of crown represents Which Nolla's stage:A)Stage 1\nB)Stage 2\nC)Stage 3\nD)Stage 4", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Initial calcification of the crown represents the first stage of Nolla's stages of emotional development, which is also known as the \"Impulsive\" stage.
