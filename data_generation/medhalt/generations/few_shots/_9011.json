Egodistonic obsessions are those that are not consistent with the individual's values, beliefs, or goals, while egosyntonic obsessions are those that are consistent with the individual's values, beliefs, or goals. This specification is important for diagnosing OCD because the content of the obsessions can provide insight into the underlying psychological processes that are driving the disorder.\n\n"}, {"question": "Chloroquine related eye disease risk is", "correct_answer": "HIV reverse transcriptase", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)HIV protease", "B)HIV reverse transcriptase", "C)HIV integrase", "D)HIV entry into the cell"], "prompt": "Chloroquine related eye disease risk isA)HIV protease\nB)HIV reverse transcriptase\nC)HIV integrase\nD)HIV entry into the cell", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is sometimes used to treat HIV-related opportunistic infections.
