The WELL's score is a useful tool to assess the risk of PE, and based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the risk is considered to be medium.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's history of bladder cancer is not considered a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient's dyspnea and tachycardia are not specific symptoms of pulmonary embolism. While the patient does have a DVT, the presence of a DVT alone does not necessarily indicate a high risk for pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the patient's risk for pulmonary embolism is considered low.\n\n", "output3": "The WELL's score is a clinical prediction rule that assesses the risk of pulmonary embolism in patients with a history of cancer and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the score is not reliable without d-dimer values, which are blood tests that measure the presence of blood clots. Therefore, without d-dimer values, it is not possible to accurately assess the risk of pulmonary embolism.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which pa of brachial plexus do not give branches", "correct_answer": "Division", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Root", "B)Division", "C)Cord", "D)Trunk"], "prompt": "Which pa of brachial plexus do not give branchesA)Root\nB)Division\nC)Cord\nD)Trunk", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "output0": "The Root of the Brachial Plexus does not give rise to branches.

This blockage prevents the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue.\n\n", "output2": "In Pemphigus vulgaris, autoantibodies are produced that bind to the cell surface of skin and mucous membrane cells, blocking the function of these cells and leading to the symptoms of the disease.\n\n", "output3": "Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease caused by autoantibodies that block the function of the target cell. In this case, the target cells are the podocytes in the kidney, which are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood.
