This approach is effective in reducing the risk of headache by minimizing the amount of local anaesthetic that is injected into the spinal canal.\n\n", "output1": "Preloading with crystalloids is the most effective way to prevent headache during spinal anaesthesia. This approach involves administering a small amount of crystalloid solution into the spinal canal before the local anaesthetic. This helps to reduce the risk of headache by reducing the amount of local anaesthetic that is needed and by helping to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier.\n\n", "output2": "The use of a finer I.P. needle can help to reduce the risk of headache during spinal anaesthesia. This is because a finer needle is less likely to cause trauma to the surrounding tissue, which can lead to inflammation and pain.\n\n", "output3": "Elevating the head end of the patient during spinal anaesthesia can help prevent headaches by reducing the risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. This is because the CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, and when it leaks out, it can cause a headache. By elevating the head end of the patient, the CSF is less likely to leak out, which can help prevent headaches.\n\n"}, {"question": "Ex-Press glaucoma implant is made up of?", "correct_answer": "Stainless steel", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Silicone", "B)Titanium", "C)Gold", "D)Stainless steel"], "prompt": "Ex-Press glaucoma implant is made up of?A)Silicone\nB)Titanium\nC)Gold\nD)Stainless steel", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "output0": "The Ex-Press glaucoma implant is made up of silicone because it is a soft, flexible material that can be easily inserted into the eye and can be removed if necessary.
