By blocking the \u03bc receptor, naloxone can reverse the effects of opioids and help to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\n", "output1": "Naloxone is a \u03b4-opioid receptor antagonist, which means that it binds to the \u03b4-opioid receptor and prevents the action of opioids at that site.\n\n", "output2": "Naloxone is a \u03ba-opioid antagonist, which means it blocks the effects of \u03ba-opioid receptors. It is commonly used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose.\n\n", "output3": "Naloxone is a opioid antagonist that acts at all three types of opioid receptors: a\u03bc (mu), \u03b4 (delta), and \u03ba (kappa).

The presence of valine instead of lysine in the tRNA will signal to the ribosome that the tRNA is mischarged, and it will be rejected and degraded.\n\n", "output1": "The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated into the codons that specify for lysine because the ribosome recognizes the tRNA as a lysine tRNA and does not distinguish between the correct and mischarged amino acids. The incorporation of the mischarged tRNA will result in the peptide being incorrect.\n\n", "output2": "The mischarged tRNA will be degraded by the proteasome because it is not a valid tRNA molecule. The ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA as a non-cognate tRNA and will not be able to incorporate it into the growing peptide. The proteasome will then degrade the mischarged tRNA to prevent its incorporation into the peptide.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)The mischarged tRNA will be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase. This is because the lysyl-tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that specifically recognizes and removes mischarged tRNAs that have the wrong amino acid attached. In this case, the tRNA that has been biochemically charged with valine instead of lysine will be recognized and removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase, preventing its incorporation into the growing peptide.\n\n"}, {"question": "CA-125 is?", "correct_answer": "Mucin glycoprotein", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Mucin glycoprotein", "B)Carcinoma transmigration antigen", "C)Mucopolysaccharide", "D)Lipid"], "prompt": "CA-125 is?A)Mucin glycoprotein\nB)Carcinoma transmigration antigen\nC)Mucopolysaccharide\nD)Lipid", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "CA-125 is a mucin glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including ovarian cancer.
