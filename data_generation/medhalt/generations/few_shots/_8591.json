This is because isoniazid is metabolized to a toxic compound called hydrazine, which can damage the retina and other tissues in the eye.\n\n", "output1": "Rifampicin is an anti-tubercular drug that can cause ophthalmological toxicity, particularly in the form of retinal damage. This is because rifampicin is metabolized by the liver to form a reactive metabolite that can damage the retina.\n\n", "output2": "Ethambutol is known to cause ophthalmological toxicity, particularly optic neuritis and retinal damage. This is due to the drug's high affinity for the retina and the optic nerve.\n\n", "output3": "Pyrazinamide can cause ophthalmological toxicity, particularly optic neuritis, which can lead to vision loss. This is because pyrazinamide can accumulate in the retina and cause damage to the optic nerve.\n\n"}, {"question": "Cardiac pain may be transmitted to the jaw due to the overlapping of:", "correct_answer": "5th cranial nerve, third cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)5th cranial nerve, third cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve", "B)7th cranial nerve, third cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve", "C)5th cranial nerve, second cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve", "D)7th cranial nerve, second cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve"], "prompt": "Cardiac pain may be transmitted to the jaw due to the overlapping of:A)5th cranial nerve, third cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve\nB)7th cranial nerve, third cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve\nC)5th cranial nerve, second cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve\nD)7th cranial nerve, second cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "output0": "Cardiac pain may be transmitted to the jaw due to the overlap of the 5th cranial nerve, third cervical nerve, and first thoracic nerve. These nerves innervate the muscles of mastication and the jaw joint, and can transmit pain signals from the heart to the jaw.\n\n", "output1": "The cardiac pain may be transmitted to the jaw due to the overlapping of the 7th cranial nerve, third cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve. These nerves are responsible for transmitting sensation from the heart to the brain and can cause referred pain to the jaw and other areas of the head and neck.\n\n", "output2": "The T5 nerve, which is the 5th cranial nerve, innervates the muscles of mastication and the second cervical nerve and the first thoracic nerve also innervate the muscles of mastication.

These nerves overlap in the neck and jaw area, allowing pain signals from the heart to be transmitted to the jaw.\n\n"}, {"question": "On loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, which of the following is present:", "correct_answer": "Compression on upper border", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Tension on upper border", "B)Compression on upper border", "C)Compression on medial surface", "D)Compression on inferior surface"], "prompt": "On loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, which of the following is present:A)Tension on upper border\nB)Compression on upper border\nC)Compression on medial surface\nD)Compression on inferior surface", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "When a mandible fracture is loaded posterior to the site of fracture, there is typically tension on the upper border of the mandible. This is because the fracture is being pulled apart, and the upper border is being stretched.\n\n", "output1": "When the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture is loaded, there is compression on the upper border of the mandible, which is the most prominent feature of the Turtle Technique. This compression helps to reduce the displacement of the fracture and promote healing.\n\n", "output2": "When the mandible is fractured, the bone may shift posteriorly, which can cause compression on the medial surface of the bone. This compression can lead to tension on the upper border of the bone, which is the opposite of what is expected. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n", "output3": "When loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, there is compression on the inferior surface of the mandible.
