However, glycogen synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Since the ER and cytoplasm are separated by a membrane, the enzyme cannot act on glycogen formed in the cytoplasm. Therefore, the glucose-6-phosphate, freshly synthesized during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm, is not immediately degraded by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase.\n\n", "output2": "Glycogenesis and glycogenolysis are tightly regulated such that enzymes of only one of those is present at a time to prevent the immediate degradation of newly synthesized glycogen. This is important to maintain the balance of glucose in the body and to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.\n\n", "output3": "The glucose-6-phosphate, freshly synthesized during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, is not immediately degraded by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase because of steric hindrance due to albumin. Albumin is a large protein that is present in the cytoplasm and can block the active site of the enzyme, preventing it from degrading the glucose-6-phosphate.
