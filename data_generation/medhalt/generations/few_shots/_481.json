Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and modulate the immune system. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of coughing, wheezing, and fever, along with the radiographic findings of atelectasis and branched radiodensities, suggest that she has developed an allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).

Additionally, a non-contrast CT may not be able to provide the same level of detail as a CT angiogram with contrast.
