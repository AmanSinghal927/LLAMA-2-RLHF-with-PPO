By inhibiting the activity of GAPDH, niclosamide reduces the amount of glucose that is available for energy production, leading to a decrease in the amount of ATP that is produced. This decrease in ATP production can help to reduce the energy demands of the cell, which in turn can help to improve the symptoms of the disease.\n\n", "output1": "Niclosamide inhibits the activity of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is involved in the citric acid cycle. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, which is the primary mechanism of energy production in cells.\n\n", "output2": "Niclosamide inhibits proton efflux pumps, which are enzymes that help to maintain the acidity of certain organelles in the cell. By inhibiting these pumps, niclosamide can increase the pH of these organelles, leading to changes in the activity of various enzymes and other proteins.\n\n", "output3": "Niclosamide is a drug that inhibits the activity of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which is responsible for the production of free radicals in cells. By inhibiting this enzyme, niclosamide reduces the production of free radicals and can help to prevent oxidative stress and cellular damage.\n\n"}, {"question": "Maximum level of alpha fetoprotein is seen in:", "correct_answer": "Fetal serum", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Fetal serum", "B)Placenta", "C)Amniotic fluid", "D)Maternal serum"], "prompt": "Maximum level of alpha fetoprotein is seen in:A)Fetal serum\nB)Placenta\nC)Amniotic fluid\nD)Maternal serum", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The maximum level of alpha fetoprotein is seen in fetal serum because it is a protein produced by the fetus that is secreted into the maternal bloodstream.
