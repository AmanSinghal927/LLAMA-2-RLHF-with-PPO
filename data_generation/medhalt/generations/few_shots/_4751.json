In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria lack teichoic acids and therefore cannot retain the complex.\n\n", "output2": "The reason why Gram-positive bacteria retain the complex crystal violet-iodine is that they lack porins, which are proteins that form pores in the cell membrane. These pores allow the dye to enter the cell and stain the peptidoglycan layer, resulting in the characteristic purple color. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have porins and therefore do not retain the complex.\n\n", "output3": "Gram-positive bacteria retain the complex crystal violet-iodine because they lack an external membrane, which allows the stain to penetrate the cell wall and bind to the peptidoglycan layer. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have an external membrane that prevents the stain from penetrating, resulting in a negative stain.\n\n"}, {"question": "What answer is CERTAIN regarding Candida albicans?", "correct_answer": "It is massively destroyed in the presence of fluoroquinolones.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)It is the main causative agent of pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation in critical units.", "B)It is a filamentous fungus that requires means with lamb's blood for its isolation in the microbiology laboratory.", "C)It is massively destroyed in the presence of fluoroquinolones.", "D)The infections caused by this fungus usually respond well to azo compounds."], "prompt": "What answer is CERTAIN regarding Candida albicans?A)It is the main causative agent of pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation in critical units.\nB)It is a filamentous fungus that requires means with lamb's blood for its isolation in the microbiology laboratory.\nC)It is massively destroyed in the presence of fluoroquinolones.\nD)The infections caused by this fungus usually respond well to azo compounds.", "subject_name": "medicine", "output0": "Candida albicans is a common cause of pneumonia in critically ill patients, especially those who are mechanically ventilated.
