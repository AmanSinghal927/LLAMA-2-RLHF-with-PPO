Additionally, the eradication of H. pylori, which is a common cause of duodenal ulcer, has also contributed to the reduction in morbidity. However, the primary factor responsible for the reduction in duodenal ulcer incidence is life style modification.\n\n", "output1": "The eradication of H. pylori has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence and morbidity of duodenal ulcers. This is because H. pylori infection is a major risk factor for the development of duodenal ulcers.\n\n", "output2": "Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence and prevalence of duodenal ulcers, as well as their associated morbidity. This is due to their ability to reduce the production of stomach acid, which is a key factor in the development of duodenal ulcers.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)None because while life style modifications, eradication of H. pylori, and proton pump inhibitors have all been associated with a reduction in duodenal ulcer prevalence, they have not been shown to completely eliminate the condition.\n\n"}, {"question": "Not an absolute contraindication for methylergometrine use is ?", "correct_answer": "Rh incompatibility", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Eclampsia", "B)Hea disease", "C)Rh incompatibility", "D)After delivery of first baby in twin pregnancy"], "prompt": "Not an absolute contraindication for methylergometrine use is ?A)Eclampsia\nB)Hea disease\nC)Rh incompatibility\nD)After delivery of first baby in twin pregnancy", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "Methylergometrine is a medication that is used to treat pregnancy-related hypertension and eclampsia.
