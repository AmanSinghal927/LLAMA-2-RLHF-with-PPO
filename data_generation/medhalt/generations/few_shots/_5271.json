The GI is calculated by dividing the area under the curve of the glucose response by the area under the curve of the glucose response to pure glucose. A high GI indicates that the food causes a rapid increase in blood glucose levels, while a low GI indicates a more gradual increase.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Heat exchange.
