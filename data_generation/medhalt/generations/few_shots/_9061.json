This is because the patient is blood group B- and her partner is blood group A+, which means that the fetus is Rh positive. Therefore, if the anti-D screen is negative, it indicates that the patient is not Rh positive, and RhoGam is not required. However, if the anti-D screen is positive, it indicates that the patient is Rh positive and RhoGam should be administered within 72 hours after birth, as per option C.\n\n", "output1": "Because the patient is blood type B- and her partner is blood type A+, the risk of Rh incompatibility exists. If the anti-D screen is positive, Rh D immunoglobulin (RhoGam) should be administered to prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Within 72 hours after birth if anti-D screen is negative. This is because the patient is Rh negative (B-), and her partner is Rh positive (A+). If the baby is Rh positive (A+), the mother will need to receive Rh D immunoglobulin (RhoGam) within 72 hours after birth to prevent Rh sensitization. However, if the baby is Rh negative (A-), the mother does not need to receive RhoGam.\n\n", "output3": "Rh D immunoglobulin (RhoGam) is not required in this patient because the mother's blood type is B-, which is compatible with the father's blood type A+.

This is because the muscles that control pupil size weaken with age, causing the pupils to become larger.\n\n", "output1": "As we age, the sense of taste can become more sensitive, which is known as hypergeusia. This is because the taste buds on the tongue become more prominent with age, leading to a heightened sense of taste.\n\n", "output2": "As we age, the organ of Corti in the inner ear begins to degenerate, leading to a decrease in hearing sensitivity and an increase in the sensitivity to loud noises.

One of the changes that occurs in the aging process is hyperosmia, which is an increase in sensitivity to smells. This can be due to the loss of olfactory receptors and the decrease in the number of olfactory nerve fibers.\n\n"}, {"question": "Who discovered the structure and amino acid sequence of insulin as well as the interspecies differences in molecular structure and won the Nobel prize for?", "correct_answer": "Frederick Sanger", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Prof. JJ Abel", "B)Frederick Sanger", "C)Rutter, Goodman and Uhlich", "D)Frederick Banting and Charles Best"], "prompt": "Who discovered the structure and amino acid sequence of insulin as well as the interspecies differences in molecular structure and won the Nobel prize for?A)Prof. JJ Abel\nB)Frederick Sanger\nC)Rutter, Goodman and Uhlich\nD)Frederick Banting and Charles Best", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "Prof. JJ Abel discovered the structure and amino acid sequence of insulin as well as the interspecies differences in molecular structure.
