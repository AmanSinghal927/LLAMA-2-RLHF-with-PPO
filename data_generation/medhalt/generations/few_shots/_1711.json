This nutrient is important for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and a deficiency can lead to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.\n\n", "output1": "An increase in lactate and pyruvate is a sign of a deficiency of niacin, also known as vitamin B3. Niacin is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, and a deficiency can lead to impaired energy production and increased lactate and pyruvate levels.\n\n", "output2": "Increased levels of lactate and pyruvate in the blood can be a sign of a thiamine deficiency. Thiamine is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in energy metabolism and the production of ATP. Without enough thiamine, the body may not be able to efficiently convert glucose into energy, leading to an accumulation of lactate and pyruvate.\n\n", "output3": "Retinoic acid is a vitamin A derivative that is essential for the proper functioning of the body's metabolic processes. It plays a key role in the production of energy from glucose, and a deficiency in retinoic acid can lead to a buildup of lactate and pyruvate in the body.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 25-year-old woman, no special past history, there is a lump in his right armpit and a weight loss of 5 kg in a month and to the hospital for treatment, the readme no fever, night sweats, cough, shortness of breath or abdominal pain and other symptoms, physical examination in addition to a right armpit 5 \u00d7 6 cm, fixed, painless lumps remaining are other than normal, nor palpable breast lumps of.
