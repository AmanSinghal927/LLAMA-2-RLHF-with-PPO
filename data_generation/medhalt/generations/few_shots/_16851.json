This is because the 500 Hz tuning fork is a high-frequency sound that is more likely to be heard in the left ear, which has a higher sensitivity to high-frequency sounds. As a result, the Rinne test would likely show a negative result in the right ear, indicating that the right ear is not functioning properly.\n\n", "output2": "When using a 500 Hz tuning fork in an idiopathic right ear deafness, the Rinne test would likely show a positive result in the left ear and a Weber test would show a movement towards the right ear.
