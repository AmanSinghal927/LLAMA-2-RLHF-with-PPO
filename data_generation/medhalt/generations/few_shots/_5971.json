This is especially true in children, who may metabolize bilirubin more slowly than adults.\n\n", "output1": "The postoperative bilirubin level of 6 mg/dL after a surgery for biliary stricture with hepatojejunal anastomosis could be caused by an anastomotic stricture. This is because the anastomosis is a new connection between the bile duct and the small intestine, and it may take time for the bile to flow properly through the anastomosis, leading to a higher bilirubin level.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Delta bilirubin. In this case, the postoperative bilirubin level of 6 mg/dL is likely due to a delta bilirubin, which is a difference between the preoperative and postoperative bilirubin levels. This is a common phenomenon after surgery for biliary atresia, as the anastomosis can lead to a temporary increase in bilirubin production.\n\n", "output3": "The reason for the postoperative bilirubin level of 6 mg/dL after a preoperative level of 12 mg/dL is likely due to a mistake in the laboratory technique. Bilirubin levels can take time to lower, and anastomotic stricture is unlikely to cause such a rapid decrease. Delta bilirubin is not a valid term.\n\n"}, {"question": "The best stimulator of respiratory centre is:", "correct_answer": "Increase in arterial carbon dioxide level", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Decrease in arterial carbon dioxide level", "B)Increase in arterial carbon dioxide level", "C)Increase in arterial oxygen level", "D)None of the above"], "prompt": "The best stimulator of respiratory centre is:A)Decrease in arterial carbon dioxide level\nB)Increase in arterial carbon dioxide level\nC)Increase in arterial oxygen level\nD)None of the above", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "The best stimulator of the respiratory centre is a decrease in arterial carbon dioxide level.
