This is considered the optimal stage for implantation and has been shown to improve pregnancy rates.\n\n", "output1": "In IVF, embryos are typically transferred back to the uterine cavity at the 4-cell stage, which is around 4-5 days after fertilization. This is because the 4-cell stage is when the embryo has reached a certain level of development and is more likely to implant successfully.\n\n", "output2": "Embryos are typically transferred back to the uterine cavity at the 8-cell stage, which is around the time of the first trimester. This is considered the optimal time for transfer, as it is believed that the embryo has a better chance of implanting and developing into a healthy fetus.\n\n", "output3": "The optimal time for embryo transfer in IVF is when the embryos are at the blastocyst stage, which is around 16-Aug. This is because blastocysts have a higher implantation rate and better developmental potential than earlier stage embryos.\n\n"}, {"question": "Quinine acts on which stage of plasmodium life cycle?", "correct_answer": "Erythrocytic", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Exoerythrocytic", "B)Pre-erythrocytic", "C)Erythrocytic", "D)All of the above"], "prompt": "Quinine acts on which stage of plasmodium life cycle?A)Exoerythrocytic\nB)Pre-erythrocytic\nC)Erythrocytic\nD)All of the above", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "Quinine acts on the exoerythrocytic stage of the Plasmodium life cycle, which is the stage outside of the red blood cells.
