Specifically, the high energy phosphate compound formed through this process is ATP.\n\n", "output1": "In the citric acid cycle, the high energy phosphate compound formed through substrate level phosphorylation is TTP (triphosphate). This compound is formed when acetyl-CoA is converted into citrate through the enzyme citrate synthase.\n\n", "output2": "In the citric acid cycle, the high energy phosphate compound formed through substrate level phosphorylation is ITP (Inositol Triphosphate). This compound is formed when the cycle intermediate, citrate, is phosphorylated to form ITP. ITP can then be used to synthesize ATP through the electron transport chain.\n\n", "output3": "In the citric acid cycle, the high energy phosphate compound formed through substrate level phosphorylation is GTP. This is because the citric acid cycle produces NADH and FADH2, which are then used to generate ATP through the electron transport chain.

The presence of these walls helps to retain the inlay in place and prevents it from being dislodged or displaced.\n\n", "output1": "The retention of an inlay is primarily influenced by the flat pulpal and gingival wall. This is because the flat wall provides a larger surface area for the adhesive to bond to, resulting in a more secure retention of the inlay.\n\n", "output2": "The presence of contra bevels can influence the retention of an inlay. Contra bevels are small grooves or depressions that are cut into the tooth structure around the preparation to help retain the inlay. The contra bevels create a mechanical lock between the inlay and the tooth structure, which helps to keep the inlay in place.\n\n", "output3": "The retention of an inlay is influenced primarily by the preparation of slots and coves.
