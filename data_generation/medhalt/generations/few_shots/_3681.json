Increased cAMP levels can lead to a variety of physiological responses, including the regulation of gut motility and secretion.\n\n", "output1": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that regulates the release of digestive enzymes and the contraction of the gallbladder. When CCK binds to its receptor on the surface of pancreatic cells, it activates an G-protein coupled receptor that opens ion channels, leading to the increase of intracellular calcium and the release of digestive enzymes.\n\n", "output2": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) activates the IP3-DAG system, which is a signaling pathway that plays a key role in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels. The activation of the IP3-DAG system by CCK leads to the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn can trigger a variety of physiological responses.\n\n", "output3": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that activates transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Specifically, CCK activates the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which in turn regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses.\n\n"}, {"question": "One of the following statements regarding the treatment of eating disorders is INCORRECT.

This is because weight gain can be a complex and time-consuming process, and the patient may require more intensive treatment to address the underlying psychological and emotional issues that contribute to the eating disorder.\n\n", "output1": "It is difficult to achieve behavioral changes through psychotherapy in patients who suffer from the psychological effects of extreme thinness because of the extreme cognitive distortions that often accompany anorexia nervosa. These distortions can make it challenging for the patient to accept the reality of their situation and to make changes to their behavior.\n\n", "output2": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy is not a treatment often indicated in hospitalized patients suffering from anorexia nervosa. In fact, cognitive-behavioral therapy is often used in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, as it can help patients identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the disorder.\n\n", "output3": "Bulimia nervosa is a more severe and complex eating disorder than anorexia nervosa, and often requires hospitalization due to the high risk of complications such as electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal problems, and cardiovascular issues. In contrast, anorexia nervosa is often treated on an outpatient basis, and the main objective is to restore nutritional balance and weight gain.\n\n"}, {"question": "Hexokinase is inhibited by ?", "correct_answer": "Glucose-6-phosphate", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Glucose-6-phosphate", "B)Glucagon", "C)Glucose", "D)Insulin"], "prompt": "Hexokinase is inhibited by ?A)Glucose-6-phosphate\nB)Glucagon\nC)Glucose\nD)Insulin", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "output0": "Hexokinase is inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate because it binds to the active site of the enzyme, preventing glucose from entering the enzyme and being converted to glucose-6-phosphate.\n\n", "output1": "Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen and the release of glucose from the liver. Hexokinase, an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose, is inhibited by glucagon, which in turn inhibits glycolysis.\n\n", "output2": "Hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose to form glucose-6-phosphate.
