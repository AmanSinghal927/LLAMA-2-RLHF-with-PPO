This pattern is often seen in children who have had a pause in breathing, such as an apnea. The Cheyne-Stokes pattern can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a heart or neurological disorder.\n\n", "output3": "Apnea is a cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds, and bradycardia is a slow heart rate. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a type of breathing pattern that is often seen in adults with heart failure. None of these options is the correct answer because the child is not experiencing apnea or Cheyne-Stokes respiration.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of alcoholism presents to the emergency room vomiting bright red blood.
