Gingival abrasion is the wearing away of the gums, which can be caused by various factors such as poor oral hygiene, acidic foods and drinks, or mechanical trauma. Gingival recession, on the other hand, is the exposure of the roots of the teeth due to the loss of supporting tissue around the teeth.\n\n", "output1": "Gingival ablation is not an etiological agent for gingival recession. Gingival ablation is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a portion of the gum tissue. Gingival recession, on the other hand, is a condition where the gum tissue pulls away from the teeth, exposing the roots.\n\n", "output2": "Gingival inflammation is not an etiological agent for gingival recession. Gingival recession is caused by factors such as excessive tooth brushing, poor oral hygiene, and genetic predisposition. Gingival inflammation is a symptom of periodontal disease, which can lead to gingival recession if left untreated.\n\n", "output3": "TFO stands for Temporomandibular Joint Disorder, which is not an etiological agent for gingival recession.\n\n"}, {"question": "The following statements about the cerebellum, what's wrong?", "correct_answer": "Conduction of nerve messages about the cerebellum, came from the climbing fibers and mossy fibers responsible for the message, deep", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)cerebellar cortex into molecular layer, Purkinje cell layer and granule cell layer and three-layer structure by cell distribution", "B)Conduction of nerve messages about the cerebellum, came from the climbing fibers and mossy fibers responsible for the message, deep", "C)spinocerebellar pathway main function is to coordinate the body distal muscles (such as the hands and fingers) sports", "D)vestibulocerebellar pathway accept the vestibular apparatus and the large number of messages from the vestibular nuclei, its function and maintain the body's homeostasis closely related"], "prompt": "The following statements about the cerebellum, what's wrong?A)cerebellar cortex into molecular layer, Purkinje cell layer and granule cell layer and three-layer structure by cell distribution\nB)Conduction of nerve messages about the cerebellum, came from the climbing fibers and mossy fibers responsible for the message, deep\nC)spinocerebellar pathway main function is to coordinate the body distal muscles (such as the hands and fingers) sports\nD)vestibulocerebellar pathway accept the vestibular apparatus and the large number of messages from the vestibular nuclei, its function and maintain the body's homeostasis closely related", "subject_name": null, "output0": "The cerebellar cortex is divided into three layers: the molecular layer, the Purkinje cell layer, and the granule cell layer.

The fact that she has not consumed alcohol in weeks leading up to her admission and does not have jaundice or metabolic imbalance on laboratory tests rules out other potential causes such as substance abuse or brain metastasis.\n\n", "output1": "The most likely cause of the patient's recent mental impairment is substance abuse. Alcohol withdrawal can cause delirium, which is characterized by disorientation, confusion, and a shortened attention span. The patient's history of heavy drinking and the fact that she has not consumed alcohol for weeks prior to her admission are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "Brain metastasis is the most likely cause of the patient's recent mental impairment. This is because the patient's history of hepatic carcinoma and the fact that she has been experiencing disorientation and shortened attention span are both consistent with the symptoms of brain metastasis.

The patient's history of heavy alcohol use and recent cessation of drinking, along with her recent onset of confusion and disorientation, are all consistent with DT.
