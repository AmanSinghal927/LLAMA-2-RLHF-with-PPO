The urea cycle is responsible for breaking down amino acids in the liver, and OTC is one of the enzymes that helps to convert ornithine into citrulline. When OTC is deficient, ornithine and other amino acids cannot be properly broken down, leading to an accumulation of orotic acid and hyperammonemia.\n\n", "output1": "Arginase deficiency can lead to an accumulation of orotic acid, which is a hallmark of orotic aciduria. This enzyme is involved in the urea cycle and is responsible for the conversion of arginine to citrulline. When arginase is deficient, orotic acid cannot be properly metabolized, leading to its accumulation in the blood and urine.\n\n", "output2": "Arginine succinate synthase is the enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of arginine and succinyl-CoA into citrulline and succinate. If this enzyme is deficient, it can lead to an accumulation of orotic acid, which is a hallmark of orotic aciduria. Additionally, the deficiency can cause hyperammonemia, as the body is unable to break down the excessive amounts of ammonia that build up in the blood.\n\n", "output3": "Deficiency in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase can cause an orotic aciduria, in addition to hyperammonemia, because this enzyme is responsible for the first step of the urea cycle, which is the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline. Without this enzyme, the body cannot properly break down ammonia, leading to an accumulation of orotic acid and hyperammonemia.\n\n"}, {"question": "Clinically successfully applied to breast cancer immunotherapy, monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a following for that molecule?", "correct_answer": "Her-2 / neu", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Her-2 / neu", "B)MAG-1", "C)MUC-1", "D)CD-20"], "prompt": "Clinically successfully applied to breast cancer immunotherapy, monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a following for that molecule?A)Her-2 / neu\nB)MAG-1\nC)MUC-1\nD)CD-20", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the Her-2/neu protein, which is overexpressed in some breast cancer cells.
