This is because the presence of the antibiotic allows researchers to distinguish between cells that have taken up the recombinant DNA and those that have not.\n\n", "output1": "The number of copies of the recombinant in the culture depends on the potency of the promoter of the marker gene because the promoter is responsible for controlling the transcription of the marker gene, and the more potent the promoter, the more copies of the marker gene will be produced. This, in turn, affects the number of copies of the recombinant in the culture.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)The cloning in monocopy implies the integration of the transgene in the cell chromosome. When a plasmid is introduced into a cell, it can be integrated into the host genome in a single copy (monocopy) or in multiple copies (polycopy). If the plasmid is integrated in a single copy, it is more likely to be stably maintained in the host genome.\n\n", "output3": "The stability of a recombinant plasmid in the host culture depends on the number of copies of the plasmid in the culture. The more copies of the plasmid, the more likely it is that the plasmid will be stably maintained in the host cells.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 46-year-old woman presents with a 5-month history of worsening dry cough, occasional shortness of breath, and fatigue.
