Therefore, squatting may exacerbate the murmur and make it more difficult to hear.\n\n", "output1": "When a patient with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy disease is standing, the increased venous return to the heart can reduce the obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, which can lead to a decrease in the intensity of the systolic heart murmur.\n\n", "output2": "The use of digitalis can cause a systolic heart murmur, which may be heard in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy disease. This is because digitalis can increase the force of the heart's contractions, causing the heart valves to become more rigid and produce a murmur.\n\n", "output3": "Sublingual nitroglycerin tablets can help to reduce or even eliminate systolic heart murmurs in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This is because nitroglycerin dilates the blood vessels, reducing the pressure on the heart and mitigating the obstruction.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following hardness test is commonly used for calculating the hardness of gold:", "correct_answer": "Vicker.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Knoop.", "B)Brinnel.", "C)Rockwell.", "D)Vicker."], "prompt": "Which of the following hardness test is commonly used for calculating the hardness of gold:A)Knoop.\nB)Brinnel.\nC)Rockwell.\nD)Vicker.", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "The Knoop hardness test is commonly used for calculating the hardness of gold.
