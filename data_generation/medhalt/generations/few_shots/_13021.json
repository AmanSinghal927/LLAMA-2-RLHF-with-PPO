This is because Virapamil has a higher affinity for the calcium channels in the periodontal tissues, leading to increased blood flow and inflammation.\n\n", "output2": "Diltiazem is more potent in inducing gingival enlargement compared to other calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, virapamil, and phenytoin. This is because diltiazem has a longer half-life and is more lipophilic, which allows it to penetrate deeper into the tissues and cause more pronounced effects on the gingiva.\n\n", "output3": "Phenytoin is a drug that is commonly used to treat epilepsy and other conditions.
