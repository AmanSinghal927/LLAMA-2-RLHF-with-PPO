This is because the plaque-forming units in the mouth increase exponentially over time, and the amount of plaque reaches its maximum level around 15 days after the onset of the meal.\n\n", "output2": "According to Glickman, the maximum accumulation of plaque takes place in approximately 30 days. This is because the body's natural defense mechanisms are activated after 30 days, which can help to reduce the amount of plaque that accumulates.\n\n", "output3": "According to Glickman, the maximum accumulation of plaque takes place in approximately 60 days. This is because the bacteria that cause plaque need time to grow and multiply, and it takes about 60 days for the bacteria to reach their maximum levels.\n\n"}, {"question": "There are the following statements about patient adherence properties (compliance), and what is non?", "correct_answer": "Patients use fear and guilt to influence patient adherence, good results", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Enhance the doctor-patient relationship and help improve patient compliance of", "B)One way to improve the referral rate, but also enhance patient compliance of", "C)Patients use fear and guilt to influence patient adherence, good results", "D)For failing to follow doctor's orders and for feeling depressed, patient guilt, consider psychotherapeutic interventions Act"], "prompt": "There are the following statements about patient adherence properties (compliance), and what is non?A)Enhance the doctor-patient relationship and help improve patient compliance of\nB)One way to improve the referral rate, but also enhance patient compliance of\nC)Patients use fear and guilt to influence patient adherence, good results\nD)For failing to follow doctor's orders and for feeling depressed, patient guilt, consider psychotherapeutic interventions Act", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Enhancing the doctor-patient relationship is one way to improve patient compliance.

This statement is true because improving the doctor-patient relationship and enhancing patient compliance are both important for achieving better health outcomes.\n\n", "output2": "Patients do not use fear and guilt to improve patient adherence.

Instead, the approach focuses on helping children develop better self-control and emotional regulation skills.\n\n", "output3": "The ring thyroid muscle (cricothyroid muscle) is not paralyzed in cases of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. This is because the recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle, and paralysis of this muscle would result in a loss of vocal cord adduction and impaired breathing.
