In this case, the trypsinogen molecule is broken down into trypsin through the action of an enzyme called enterokinase.\n\n", "output1": "Trypsinogen is a serine protease that is activated to form trypsin through the process of phosphorylation. Specifically, trypsinogen is phosphorylated by the enzyme trypsin kinase to form active trypsin. This phosphorylation step is necessary for the conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin.\n\n", "output2": "The conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin involves the removal of the pa of protein, which is a non-covalent inhibitor that prevents the enzyme from activating. Once the pa of protein is removed, the trypsinogen can activate and become trypsin.\n\n", "output3": "Trypsinogen is a precursor protein that is converted to trypsin through the removal of a carboxyl group.
