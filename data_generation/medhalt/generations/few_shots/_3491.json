The median nerve provides sensation to the palmar aspect of the hand and fingers, as well as motor function to the thenar muscles.\n\n", "output1": "When a patient sustains a fracture of the distal radius, it is common to see wrist drop, loss of extension at the fingers, and loss of sensation on the lateral aspect of the wrist joint. This is due to the injury to the radial nerve, which is located in the spiral groove of the distal radius and is responsible for controlling extension of the wrist and fingers. Therefore, the patient should have also lost extension of the forearm, which is controlled by the radial nerve.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of wrist drop, loss of extension at the fingers, and loss of sensation on the lateral aspect of the wrist joint are consistent with injury to the radial nerve in the spiral groove. The median nerve is not involved in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of loss of sensation or weakness in the hand or fingers.\n\n", "output3": "The symptoms described by the patient (wrist drop, loss of extension at fingers, and loss of sensation on the lateral aspect of the wrist joint) are consistent with injury to both the radial nerve and the median nerve.
