In X linked recessive inheritance, the gene is located on the X chromosome and the affected individual is a carrier, meaning they have one copy of the mutated gene and one normal copy. Females are more likely to be carriers and pass the mutated gene to their sons, who will be affected, while their daughters will be carriers like their mother. Males, on the other hand, cannot pass the mutated gene to their daughters, but they can pass it to their sons, who will be affected.\n\n", "output1": "The statement \"An affected male does not have affected children but an affected female always has affected children\" suggests that the trait is autosomal recessive.

In this type of inheritance, the affected female will always have affected children, while the affected male will not have affected children.
