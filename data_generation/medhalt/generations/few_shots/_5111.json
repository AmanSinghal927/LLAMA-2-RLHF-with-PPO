[{"question": "Tuberculosis of spine most commonly affects which veebral segment?", "correct_answer": "Lower dorsal", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Upper dorsal", "B)Lower dorsal", "C)Lumbar", "D)Cervical"], "prompt": "Tuberculosis of spine most commonly affects which veebral segment?A)Upper dorsal\nB)Lower dorsal\nC)Lumbar\nD)Cervical", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "Tuberculosis of the spine most commonly affects the upper dorsal segment, specifically the thoracic spine, due to the proximity of the lungs and the fact that the upper dorsal vertebrae have a greater amount of cartilage, which makes them more susceptible to infection.\n\n", "output1": "Tuberculosis of the spine most commonly affects the lower dorsal segment, which includes the lumbar and sacral vertebrae. This is because the lower back is more prone to injury and infection due to the increased weight and strain placed on it.\n\n", "output2": "Tuberculosis of the spine most commonly affects the lumbar vertebral segment because it is the area of the spine that is most exposed to the outside environment and is therefore more susceptible to infection. Additionally, the lumbar vertebrae are larger and more mobile than other vertebrae, which can make them more vulnerable to injury and disease.\n\n", "output3": "Tuberculosis of the spine most commonly affects the cervical spine, which is the upper part of the spine that supports the head and neck. This is because the cervical spine is more susceptible to infection due to its location and the fact that it is less protected by muscles and bones than other parts of the spine.\n\n"}, {"question": "Not a feature of SIRS:", "correct_answer": "Hypoxemia", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Respiratory rate >20 breaths/min", "B)Heart rate >90/min", "C)Temperature >38\u00b0C", "D)Hypoxemia"], "prompt": "Not a feature of SIRS:A)Respiratory rate >20 breaths/min\nB)Heart rate >90/min\nC)Temperature >38\u00b0C\nD)Hypoxemia", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "The correct answer is A)Respiratory rate >20 breaths/min because the Turtle Technique is not a feature of SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome).

This is because the upper esophagus is more exposed to the acid reflux and other factors that can cause cancer.\n\n", "output2": "The lower 2/3rd of the esophagus is the most common site of esophageal carcinoma. This is because the lower esophagus is more susceptible to the effects of acid reflux, which is a major risk factor for the development of esophageal cancer.\n\n", "output3": "The middle 2/3rd of the esophagus is the most common site of esophageal carcinoma, with approximately 70% of esophageal cancers occurring in this region. This is due to the fact that the esophageal mucosa in this area is more susceptible to the effects of gastric acid and other noxious substances, which can lead to the development of precancerous changes and eventually cancer.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior.

Reducing calcium intake will help to reduce the amount of oxalate in the urine, which will decrease the risk of stone formation.\n\n", "output1": "Decreasing sodium intake is the most likely intervention to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient, as excess sodium intake is a risk factor for the development of calcium oxalate stones.\n\n", "output2": "Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds is the most likely intervention to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient. Nuts and seeds are high in magnesium, which is a naturally occurring substance that can help to prevent kidney stones. Calcium oxalate stones, like the one this patient passed, are often associated with low magnesium intake.\n\n", "output3": "Urine acidification with cranberry juice is the most effective intervention for preventing renal calculi formation in this patient. Cranberry juice contains high levels of anthocyanins, which have been shown to inhibit the adhesion of bacteria to the bladder and urinary tract walls. By inhibiting bacterial adhesion, cranberry juice can help prevent the formation of new kidney stones. Additionally, cranberry juice may also help to acidify the urine, which can decrease the risk of stone formation.\n\n"}, {"question": "Ante mortem rabies diagnosis is made commonly from?", "correct_answer": "Skin biopsy", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Corneal scraping", "B)Brain biopsy", "C)Skin biopsy", "D)Saliva"], "prompt": "Ante mortem rabies diagnosis is made commonly from?A)Corneal scraping\nB)Brain biopsy\nC)Skin biopsy\nD)Saliva", "subject_name": "Unknown", "output0": "Ante mortem rabies diagnosis is commonly made from corneal scraping because it is a non-invasive and relatively simple procedure that can detect the presence of rabies virus in the salivary glands of an infected animal.\n\n", "output1": "Ante mortem rabies diagnosis is typically made from a brain biopsy.
