This is known as corrosion by concentration.\n\n", "output1": "The process by which a steel pipe connected to a copper pipe in a domestic hot water heater corrodes in the vicinity of the union is called corrosion by differential aeration. This occurs when there is a difference in aeration between the two pipes, causing the copper pipe to be more aerated than the steel pipe. This difference in aeration leads to a difference in corrosion rates between the two pipes, resulting in corrosion of the steel pipe.\n\n", "output2": "The process of corrosion that occurs in the vicinity of the union between a steel pipe and a copper pipe in a domestic hot water heater is called corrosion due to the formation of a concentration cell. This is because the steel pipe is more noble than the copper pipe, and as a result, the steel pipe will corrode more quickly in the presence of an electrolyte. The union between the two pipes creates a concentration cell, which can accelerate the corrosion process.\n\n", "output3": "Galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals are in contact with each other in the presence of an electrolyte, causing one metal to corrode more quickly than the other. In the case of a steel pipe connected to a copper pipe in a domestic hot water heater, the steel pipe is more noble than the copper pipe, so it corrodes more quickly due to the galvanic effect.\n\n"}, {"question": "Pancreatic \u03b2 cell membrane surface of what kind of glucose transporter protein (glucose transporter, GLUT) is responsible for glucose into cells?", "correct_answer": "GLUT2", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)GLUT1", "B)GLUT2", "C)GLUT3", "D)GLUT4"], "prompt": "Pancreatic \u03b2 cell membrane surface of what kind of glucose transporter protein (glucose transporter, GLUT) is responsible for glucose into cells?A)GLUT1\nB)GLUT2\nC)GLUT3\nD)GLUT4", "subject_name": null, "output0": "GLUT1 is responsible for glucose uptake into pancreatic \u03b2 cells.
