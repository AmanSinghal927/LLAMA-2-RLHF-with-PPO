The patient's history of irregular periods, heavy flow, and the absence of menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months are all consistent with uterine fibroids. Additionally, the patient's BMI of 27.02 kg/m2 and her father's history of diabetes mellitus suggest that she may be at risk for developing insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which are both associated with uterine fibroids.\n\n", "output1": "The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a congenital defect of the Mullerian ducts, specifically a defect in the formation of the uterus and/or fallopian tubes. This is suggested by the patient's history of irregular menstrual cycles, lack of menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months, and the presence of a normal vagina and cervix on pelvic examination. Additionally, the patient's mother has a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a common cause of congenital defects of the Mullerian ducts.\n\n", "output2": "The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is purging behavior. The patient has a history of manic episode and is conscious of her weight and appearance, which suggests that she may be engaging in unhealthy eating habits or purging to control her weight. The patient's low body mass index (BMI) and the presence of amenorrhea also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and the fact that she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months further support the diagnosis of purging behavior.\n\n", "output3": "The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is anovulation, which is the absence of ovulation. Anovulation is a common cause of menstrual irregularities, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and thyroid disorders. In this case, the patient's history of irregular menstrual cycles, lack of menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months, and hormonal imbalances (elevated prolactin and low estrogen) all point towards anovulation as the most likely cause of her symptoms.\n\n"}, {"question": "Nasal vestibule is", "correct_answer": "Antero - inferior pa of nasal cavity", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Lateral pa of nasal cavity", "B)Antero - inferior pa of nasal cavity", "C)Supero - medial pa of nose", "D)Posterior apeure of nose"], "prompt": "Nasal vestibule isA)Lateral pa of nasal cavity\nB)Antero - inferior pa of nasal cavity\nC)Supero - medial pa of nose\nD)Posterior apeure of nose", "subject_name": "ENT", "output0": "The nasal vestibule is a lateral part of the nasal cavity.
