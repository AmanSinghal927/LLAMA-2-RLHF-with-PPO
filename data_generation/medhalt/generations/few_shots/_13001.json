Erythroblastosis fetalis is a condition that occurs when an Rh-negative mother's body produces antibodies against her Rh-positive baby's red blood cells. The antibodies are produced in response to the baby's Rh-positive red blood cells, which are detected by the mother's immune system as foreign. Anti-C is an antibody that is produced in response to the C antigen, which is present on the surface of red blood cells. It is not involved in Erythroblastosis fetalis because it is not a factor in the development of the condition.\n\n", "output1": "Anti-D is not involved in Erythroblastosis fetalis because it is not a Rh blood group antigen. Erythroblastosis fetalis is a condition that occurs when the fetus has a different Rh blood type from the mother, and the mother's immune system mounts an immune response against the fetus's Rh-positive red blood cells. Anti-D is an antibody that is produced in response to Rh-positive red blood cells, but it is not involved in Erythroblastosis fetalis because it is not a factor in this condition.\n\n", "output2": "Anti E is not involved in Erythroblastosis fetalis.

This leads to a more reliable anticoagulant effect, as the heparin is more likely to be actively circulating in the bloodstream rather than being bound to proteins.\n\n", "output2": "LMWH is given subcutaneously, which allows it to be absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly and reliably than unfractionated heparin, which is given intravenously. This results in more consistent anticoagulant effects with LMWH.\n\n", "output3": "LMWH is cleared by macrophages, which are cells that engulf and digest foreign substances, including blood clots.
