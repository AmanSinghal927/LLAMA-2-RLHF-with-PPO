In this case, the pregnancy should be terminated at 40 completed weeks of gestation, as the presence of preeclampsia with severe features (BP of 150/100 mm of Hg) increases the risk of complications for both the mother and the baby. It is generally recommended to deliver at 40 completed weeks to avoid any potential risks.\n\n", "output1": "The pregnancy should be terminated at 37 completed weeks because preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a complication of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). PPROM is a serious condition that can lead to preterm delivery, which can be life-threatening for the baby. By terminating the pregnancy at 37 weeks, the risk of preterm delivery is reduced.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)35 completed weeks. The recommended termination of pregnancy for a 27-year primigravida with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and a blood pressure of 150/100 mm of Hg at 32 weeks of gestation is 35 completed weeks.
