The dovetailing mechanism involves a series of interlocking teeth that fit together to provide a secure fit and stability.\n\n", "output1": "Slots, pins and grooves are effective in obtaining extra retention in abutment teeth because they provide additional anchorage points for the dental prosthesis. This helps to stabilize the prosthesis and prevent it from moving or rotating.\n\n", "output2": "Outline form is a technique used to obtain extra retention in abutment teeth. It involves creating a clear outline of the tooth structure, which helps to guide the placement of the restoration and ensure a proper fit. This technique is often used in conjunction with other retention methods, such as dovetail or slots, pins and grooves, to achieve optimal results.\n\n", "output3": "Increasing tooth reduction is a technique used to improve the retention of abutment teeth in dental implants. By reducing the height of the teeth, the implant can be placed more securely, which helps to prevent loosening and improve the overall success of the procedure.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a cause of secondary Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?", "correct_answer": "Rheumatoid ahritis", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Systemic lupus erythmatosus", "B)Hepatitis C infection", "C)Rheumatoid ahritis", "D)HIV infection"], "prompt": "Which of the following is not a cause of secondary Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?A)Systemic lupus erythmatosus\nB)Hepatitis C infection\nC)Rheumatoid ahritis\nD)HIV infection", "subject_name": "Medicine", "output0": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is not a known cause of secondary idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
