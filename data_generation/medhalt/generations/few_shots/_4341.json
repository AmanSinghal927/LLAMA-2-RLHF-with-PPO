This is because the MB2 is a relatively small feature, and it can be difficult to visualize it with the naked eye or with a conventional dental microscope. However, with the use of a dental operating microscope, which provides higher magnification and better illumination, the MB2 can be more easily identified in a larger percentage of cases.\n\n", "output2": "The percentage of cases where MB2 (in maxillary first molar) can be seen through a dental operating microscope is approximately 62-70%. This is because the maxillary first molar is one of the most common teeth to be affected by dental caries, and the dental operating microscope is a valuable tool for detecting and diagnosing dental caries at an early stage.\n\n", "output3": "The MB2 (in maxillary first molar) can be seen through a dental operating microscope in 30-40% of cases, as it is not always possible to visualize this structure due to various factors such as the size and position of the tooth, the amount of dental plaque and calculus, and the skill of the dentist.\n\n"}, {"question": "Chin cup was introduced by:", "correct_answer": "Oppenheim", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Norwegian", "B)Oppenheim", "C)Burston", "D)Nance"], "prompt": "Chin cup was introduced by:A)Norwegian\nB)Oppenheim\nC)Burston\nD)Nance", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "The Chin Cup was introduced by a Norwegian psychologist named Ingrid Burton.
