During cavity preparation, some of these cells may be killed. The undifferentiated cells that are present in the pulp chamber are able to differentiate into odontoblasts to replace the lost cells.\n\n", "output2": "The odontoblasts killed during cavity preparation are derived from histocytes. Histocytes are specialized cells that are found in the dental pulp and play a critical role in maintaining the health of the tooth. When a cavity is prepared, the dentist must remove the infected or damaged pulp tissue. This can result in the death of some of the histocytes, which can lead to inflammation and pain.\n\n", "output3": "Odontoblasts are derived from the dental papilla, which is a structure in the dental pulp. During cavity preparation, some of the odontoblasts may be killed, but the remaining odontoblasts will continue to produce dentin.
