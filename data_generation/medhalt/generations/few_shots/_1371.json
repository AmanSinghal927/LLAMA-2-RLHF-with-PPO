Additionally, it is well-tolerated and has a low risk of adverse effects, making it a good option for patients who are already compromised.\n\n", "output1": "Beta Lactam antibiotics with beta lactamase are the most appropriate choice for a bedridden patient with catheter-related UTI and pneumonia, as they are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and they are less likely to cause adverse reactions such as allergic reactions or diarrhea compared to other antibiotics.\n\n", "output2": "The choice of antibiotic for a bedridden patient with catheter-related UTI and pneumonia should be a 3rd generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. These antibiotics have a high degree of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common cause of UTI and pneumonia in this patient population. Additionally, they are effective against a wide range of other pathogens that may be present in the patient's bloodstream.\n\n", "output3": "For a bedridden patient with catheter-related UTI and pneumonia, the best antibiotic choice would be a 2nd generation cephalosporin. This is because 2nd generation cephalosporins have a broader spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including those that are commonly found in UTIs and pneumonia. Additionally, 2nd generation cephalosporins are more likely to be effective against bacteria that are resistant to earlier generation cephalosporins.\n\n"}, {"question": "The diffusion coefficient, D, for a spherical particle:", "correct_answer": "It depends on the temperature, pressure and composition of the solution.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)It is independent of the size of the molecule that diffuses.", "B)It is independent of temperature.", "C)It is independent of the viscosity of the solution.", "D)It depends on the temperature, pressure and composition of the solution."], "prompt": "The diffusion coefficient, D, for a spherical particle:A)It is independent of the size of the molecule that diffuses.\nB)It is independent of temperature.\nC)It is independent of the viscosity of the solution.\nD)It depends on the temperature, pressure and composition of the solution.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "The diffusion coefficient, D, for a spherical particle is independent of the size of the molecule that diffuses, because the diffusion process is governed by the particle's size and shape, not by the size of the molecule.\n\n", "output1": "The diffusion coefficient, D, for a spherical particle is independent of temperature. This is because the temperature only affects the speed of the molecules, not their diffusion.\n\n", "output2": "The diffusion coefficient, D, for a spherical particle is independent of the viscosity of the solution.

These tumors are often more responsive to treatment and have a better prognosis than other types of liver cancer.\n\n", "output2": "The prognosis for surgery for liver secondaries is best for genitourinary cancers, specifically kidney and bladder cancer, as these tumors are more likely to be resectable and have a better response to surgical treatment.\n\n", "output3": "The prognosis for surgery for liver secondaries is best for esophageal cancer because it is a more localized and less aggressive cancer than the other options.
