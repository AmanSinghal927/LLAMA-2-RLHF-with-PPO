This is because the aluminum filter absorbs some of the radiation that would otherwise be directed towards the patient's skin, thus reducing the amount of radiation that is needed to produce a diagnostic image.\n\n", "output1": "The aluminium filter in the primary beam of radiation is used to reduce the exposure time of the films. This is because the filter allows only the most penetrating radiation to reach the film, resulting in a faster development time.\n\n", "output2": "The aluminum filter is placed in the primary beam of radiation to reduce the amount of radiation that reaches the patient's skin. This is done to minimize the risk of radiation-induced skin burns and other side effects associated with exposure to high levels of radiation.\n\n", "output3": "The aluminum filter is placed in the primary beam of radiation to obtain greater definition of the images of teeth. This is because the aluminum filter selectively blocks out unwanted radiation, allowing only the desired radiation to pass through and reach the film.
