The ATM protein is a key regulator of the DNA damage response and is essential for the proper development and function of muscles. The patient's fall is most likely due to the muscle weakness and lack of muscle mass associated with Muscular Dystrophy.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's history of delayed walking and the physical examination findings of enlarged calf muscles and difficulty standing up suggest a muscular dystrophy, specifically Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This is a genetic disorder that results from an absence of the dystrophin protein, which is essential for muscle strength and function. The patient's falls are likely due to muscle weakness and inability to maintain balance.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms, including delayed walking, enlarged calves, and difficulty standing up, are consistent with a diagnosis of arylsulfatase A deficiency, also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VII. This condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A, which is necessary for the breakdown of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the body. Without this enzyme, GAGs accumulate in the body, leading to a range of symptoms, including joint stiffness, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities. The patient's history of falls and the presence of swelling and pain in the ankle suggest that he may have experienced joint instability and muscle weakness, which are common symptoms of MPS.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's history of delayed walking and the presence of marked enlargement of both calves, along with the observed difficulty with standing and walking, are consistent with a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by a deficiency of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. This genetic disorder affects the nerve cells responsible for muscle movement and can cause muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the lower limbs. The patient's falls are likely due to the muscle weakness and lack of coordination that result from the underlying genetic defect.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following compounds that increase the nasal absorption of drugs acts increasing the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa ?:", "correct_answer": "Methylcellulose", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Sodium glycolate", "B)Methylcellulose", "C)EDTA", "D)Histamine."], "prompt": "Which of the following compounds that increase the nasal absorption of drugs acts increasing the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa ?:A)Sodium glycolate\nB)Methylcellulose\nC)EDTA\nD)Histamine.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "Sodium glycolate is a compound that increases the nasal absorption of drugs by increasing the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa. It does this by increasing the viscosity of the mucus, which slows down the clearance of the drug from the nasal cavity, thereby increasing the amount of time the drug is present in the nasal mucosa and available for absorption.\n\n", "output1": "Methylcellulose is a compound that increases the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa by forming a gel that adheres to the nasal mucosa, allowing for a longer residence time of the drug. This increases the amount of drug that can be absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\n", "output2": "EDTA, a compound that increases the nasal absorption of drugs, acts to increase the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa by chelating divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium, which are present in the nasal mucus. This results in the drug being more soluble in the mucus and thus more readily absorbed.\n\n", "output3": "Histamine increases the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa by increasing the permeability of the nasal mucosa to the drugs, allowing them to be absorbed more easily.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements is true in relation to the different phases of clinical trials ?:", "correct_answer": "The search for doses is one of the main objectives of phase II clinical trials.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Phase I clinical trials are performed on a very large number of patients.", "B)Phase IV clinical trials are exploratory efficacy.", "C)Bioequivalence studies are a special type of phase III trial.", "D)The search for doses is one of the main objectives of phase II clinical trials."], "prompt": "Which of the following statements is true in relation to the different phases of clinical trials ?:A)Phase I clinical trials are performed on a very large number of patients.\nB)Phase IV clinical trials are exploratory efficacy.\nC)Bioequivalence studies are a special type of phase III trial.\nD)The search for doses is one of the main objectives of phase II clinical trials.", "subject_name": "medicine", "output0": "Phase I clinical trials are conducted on a small number of healthy volunteers, typically between 20 and 100 participants, to assess the safety and tolerability of a new drug or treatment.

This will help to prevent any further damage to the tooth and ensure a successful restoration. Waiting for 7 days is not mandatory, and treating with H2O2 for 3 minutes is not necessary.\n\n", "output1": "When performing intracoronal bleaching, it is important to wait at least 7 days before placing a composite restoration. This is because bleaching can cause inflammation and sensitivity, and waiting allows the tissue to heal and reduce the risk of complications.\n\n", "output2": "When performing immediate composite restoration after intracoronal bleaching, it is important to wait for 3 minutes before placing the composite. This allows the H2O2 to dissipate and prevents the composite from being contaminated with H2O2, which can cause poor bonding and compromise the longevity of the restoration.\n\n", "output3": "Immediate composite restoration is not possible after intracoronal bleaching, as it is not a safe technique. Intracoronal bleaching is a technique that uses H2O2 to remove intrinsic stains from the dentin, and it can cause damage to the pulp if not done properly.

With direct bonding, the orthodontist can place brackets on the teeth more quickly and easily. This approach is ideal for children who are more cooperative and have a better understanding of what is expected of them.\n\n", "output2": "Direct bonding is often more expensive than the turtle technique because it requires the use of specialized equipment and a more complex procedure.
