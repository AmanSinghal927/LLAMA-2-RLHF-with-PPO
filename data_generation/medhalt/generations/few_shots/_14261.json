The secreted hypothalamic dopamine stimulates the pituitary secretion of prolactin, which in turn inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This hormonal imbalance leads to amenorrhea and lactation.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Secreted by the hypothalamus of releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion of luteinizing hormone stimulates the pituitary gland (LH). Amenorrhea is a common symptom of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis dysfunction. In this case, the patient has low thyroid hormone levels, which can lead to a decrease in luteinizing hormone secretion and subsequent amenorrhea.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea and lactation are most likely due to the influence of hormones, specifically the stimulation of pituitary prolactin secretion by the hypothalamus releasing hormone (TRH).
