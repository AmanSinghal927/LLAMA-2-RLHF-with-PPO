The patient has a history of consanguineous marriage, which increases the risk of inherited disorders such as hemoglobinopathies. The patient also has a history of repeated blood transfusions to her sibling, which suggests that there may be a hemoglobinopathy present. The HPLC test can detect the presence of hemoglobin variants and confirm the diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Blood smear. In a 34-week-old primigravida, the first diagnostic test for the diagnosis of thalassemia would be a blood smear. This is because thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy, and the presence of thalassemia in the blood can be detected by examining the blood smear under a microscope.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Bone marrow because it is the most appropriate test to evaluate the patient's bone marrow function and to detect any potential abnormalities in the production of blood cells. In this case, the patient has a history of consanguineous marriage, which increases the risk of genetic disorders, and the bone marrow examination can help to identify any potential genetic abnormalities. Additionally, the patient's history of repeated blood transfusions to her sibling since 8 months of age suggests that there may be a bleeding disorder or other hematological abnormality that needs to be evaluated.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Hb electrophoresis. This is the most appropriate diagnostic test for this patient, as it can help determine the type of hemoglobinopathy she may have, which is likely to be the cause of her anemia and the need for repeated blood transfusions.\n\n"}, {"question": "In Galactorrhoea--amenorrhea syndromes, which is the investigation you should advise (apa from serum prolactin)?", "correct_answer": "TSH", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)TSH", "B)LH", "C)hCG", "D)Urinary ketosteroids"], "prompt": "In Galactorrhoea--amenorrhea syndromes, which is the investigation you should advise (apa from serum prolactin)?A)TSH\nB)LH\nC)hCG\nD)Urinary ketosteroids", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The investigation you should advise for Galactorrhoea-amenorrhea syndromes is TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone).
