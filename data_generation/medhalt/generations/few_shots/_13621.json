When the patient swallows the tablet whole instead of allowing it to dissolve under the tongue, the medication may not be absorbed properly, leading to a decrease in its effectiveness over time. This can cause the symptoms to persist despite the patient's best efforts to manage them.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's persistent symptoms are likely due to unstable angina, which is a more severe form of angina that can be caused by a variety of factors, including a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle. The fact that the patient has been swallowing the nitroglycerin tablets whole instead of allowing them to dissolve under the tongue may have reduced the effectiveness of the medication, leading to persistent symptoms.\n\n", "output2": "When the patient swallows the sublingual nitroglycerin tablet whole instead of allowing it to dissolve under the tongue, the medication is not absorbed properly and may be metabolized before it reaches the bloodstream. This can lead to a lower bioavailability of the medication and may contribute to the patient's persistent symptoms.\n\n", "output3": "Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, can cause a significant increase in the systemic levels of nitroglycerin, leading to increased vasodilation and potentially dangerous hypotension. This is particularly concerning in patients with coronary artery disease, as it can exacerbate the symptoms of angina and increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, concomitant use of sildenafil and nitroglycerin is not recommended.\n\n"}, {"question": "Of the different lesions on the skin, the pustule is characterized by:", "correct_answer": "Vesicle or blister filled with purulent fluid.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Solid mass, prominent, palpable with a circumscribed edge.", "B)Semisolid mass in the subcutaneous tissue or the dermis.", "C)Linear crack in the skin that extends beyond the epidermis.", "D)Vesicle or blister filled with purulent fluid."], "prompt": "Of the different lesions on the skin, the pustule is characterized by:A)Solid mass, prominent, palpable with a circumscribed edge.\nB)Semisolid mass in the subcutaneous tissue or the dermis.\nC)Linear crack in the skin that extends beyond the epidermis.\nD)Vesicle or blister filled with purulent fluid.", "subject_name": "nursery", "output0": "A pustule is a solid mass, typically filled with pus, that forms on the skin as a result of infection.
