This is because the growth of the mandible is limited by the space available for the teeth, and as the space increases, the mandible grows to accommodate the extra space.\n\n", "output1": "Increased interdental spaces in elderly individuals can be a sign of hyperthyroidism, which is a condition characterized by an overactive thyroid gland. This can lead to an increase in the height of the mandible (lower jawbone) due to the excessive growth of the bone.\n\n", "output2": "An increase in interdental spaces in the elderly can be a sign of hypopituitarism, which is a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce enough hormones. This can lead to a decrease in bone density and a shorter mandible, which can result in an increase in interdental spaces.\n\n", "output3": "The increase in height of the mandible with age is associated with an increase in the interdental spaces. This is a common feature of hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH stimulates the growth and development of bone tissue, including the mandible.\n\n"}, {"question": "ADA specification of orthodontic wire:", "correct_answer": "32", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)29", "B)25", "C)32", "D)30"], "prompt": "ADA specification of orthodontic wire:A)29\nB)25\nC)32\nD)30", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "The ADA specification of orthodontic wire refers to the diameter of the wire used in orthodontic braces.

Baroreceptors are stimulated when blood pressure increases.\n\n", "output1": "Baroreceptors are afferent nerve endings that detect changes in blood pressure. They are found in the walls of the carotid sinus and aortic arch. The afferents are transmitted through the sino-aortic nerves, not through the vagus nerve as option C states.\n\n", "output2": "The other options are all correct statements about baroreceptors, but the statement that stimulation causes increased vagal discharge is incorrect. Baroreceptors are stimulated when blood pressure increases, not when it decreases.\n\n", "output3": "Baroreceptors are not stimulated when blood pressure decreases. Instead, they are stimulated when blood pressure increases. This is because the stretching of the blood vessels causes the baroreceptors to fire, sending signals to the brain to decrease blood pressure.\n\n"}, {"question": "The first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars is:", "correct_answer": "Changes in bony furcation area", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Periapical bony changes", "B)Root resorption", "C)Changes in bony furcation area", "D)Widening of apical periodontal ligament"], "prompt": "The first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars is:A)Periapical bony changes\nB)Root resorption\nC)Changes in bony furcation area\nD)Widening of apical periodontal ligament", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Periapical bony changes are the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars. These changes include the formation of a well-defined radiolucent lesion around the apex of the tooth, which is indicative of bone resorption.\n\n", "output1": "Root resorption is the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars.
