[{"question": "Where damage is most likely to result in the following patients with abnormally high muscle tone (hypertonia)?", "correct_answer": "upper motor neurons", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)a motor neurons", "B)c motor neurons", "C)upper motor neurons", "D)skeletal muscles"], "prompt": "Where damage is most likely to result in the following patients with abnormally high muscle tone (hypertonia)?A)a motor neurons\nB)c motor neurons\nC)upper motor neurons\nD)skeletal muscles", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Damage to a motor neuron can result in hypertonia, which is characterized by an abnormal increase in muscle tone. This can lead to muscle stiffness and spasticity. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n", "output1": "Damage to c motor neurons is most likely to result in abnormally high muscle tone (hypertonia) because these neurons are responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to the spinal cord and then to the muscles. When c motor neurons are damaged, the muscles may become overactive and exhibit hypertonia.\n\n", "output2": "Damage to upper motor neurons is most likely to result in abnormally high muscle tone, as these neurons play a critical role in regulating muscle activity. When these neurons are damaged, the normal inhibitory signals they send to muscles are disrupted, leading to increased muscle tone.\n\n", "output3": "Damage to the skeletal muscles is the most common cause of abnormally high muscle tone (hypertonia). This is because the muscles are the primary tissue affected by the damage, and they are responsible for the increased tone.\n\n"}, {"question": "The process of influence between individuals or groups to achieve goals, according to McCloskey and Molen, refers to:", "correct_answer": "The leadership.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)The motivation.", "B)The strategy.", "C)The leadership.", "D)The communication."], "prompt": "The process of influence between individuals or groups to achieve goals, according to McCloskey and Molen, refers to:A)The motivation.\nB)The strategy.\nC)The leadership.\nD)The communication.", "subject_name": "nursery", "output0": "The motivation is the driving force behind the process of influence.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n", "output2": "The apocrine secretion is a type of secretion that involves the release of the product of secretion, along with some of the cell's cytoplasm and plasma membrane, by a process called apocrine budding. This process is different from the merocrine secretion, which only releases the product of secretion, by exocytosis.\n\n", "output3": "In the apocrine secretion, the entire cell is released along with its contents, including the product of secretion. This is in contrast to other types of secretion, such as the merocrine secretion, where only the product of secretion is released.\n\n"}, {"question": "Question linked to the image n\u00ba24 Brain CT scan performed as a matter of urgency in the case of cranioencephalic traumatism.
