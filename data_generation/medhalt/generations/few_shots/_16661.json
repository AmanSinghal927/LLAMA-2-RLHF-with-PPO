This is because the first trimester is a critical period for the development of the fetus, and the RMP's assistance can help ensure a healthy pregnancy.\n\n", "output1": "RMP can perform MTP in the first trimester if he has assisted in MTPs for at least 15 times. This is because MTPs are more effective when performed by experienced providers, and 15 is the minimum number of times required for RMPs to gain sufficient experience.\n\n", "output2": "RMP can perform MTP in the first trimester if he has assisted in MTPs 25 times. This is because the technique is most effective when performed by a trained professional who has gained experience in the procedure.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)50 because in the first trimester, the fetus is still in the early stages of development and the risk of complications is higher. At this stage, it is generally recommended that only experienced professionals perform MTPs, and even then, only in cases where the pregnancy is not viable or when the mother's life is at risk.\n\n"}, {"question": "The Bayley Child Development Scales (BSID) apply:", "correct_answer": "During the first 2 and a half years of life.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)During the first 2 and a half years of life.", "B)From 4 to 6 years old.", "C)From 4 to 10 years old.", "D)From the first month of life to 10 years."], "prompt": "The Bayley Child Development Scales (BSID) apply:A)During the first 2 and a half years of life.\nB)From 4 to 6 years old.\nC)From 4 to 10 years old.\nD)From the first month of life to 10 years.", "subject_name": "psychology", "output0": "The Bayley Child Development Scales (BSID) are used to assess the development of children from birth to 3 years of age.
