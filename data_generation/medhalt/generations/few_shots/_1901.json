It differs from a chisel in that it has a bi-beveled edge, which means that both sides of the cutting edge are beveled at an angle. This allows for more precise cutting and shaping of bone.\n\n", "output1": "Osteotomes are uni-beveled, meaning they have a single bevel on one side of the blade. This allows for more precise and controlled cuts, which is important when working with bone. Chisels, on the other hand, have a double bevel, which makes them more versatile but less precise.\n\n", "output2": "Osteotomes have a curved shank, which allows for more precise and controlled cuts, especially in the surgical treatment of fractures.
