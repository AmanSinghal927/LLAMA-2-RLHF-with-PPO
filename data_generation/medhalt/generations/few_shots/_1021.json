The warm temperature helps to dissolve the surface impurities, while the HCl acts as a strong oxidizing agent to remove any residual impurities.\n\n", "output1": "Cold HF is effective for cleaning base metal alloys because it is a strong oxidizing agent that can dissolve and remove grease, oils, and other impurities. It is also relatively safe and non-toxic, making it a good choice for cleaning delicate metal surfaces.\n\n", "output2": "Cold H2So4 is a strong oxidizing agent that can effectively clean base metal alloys. It is also a relatively safe and non-toxic option compared to other cleaning methods like sand blasting.\n\n", "output3": "Sand blasting with aluminium oxide is a common method used to clean base metal alloys. This technique is effective for removing surface impurities and oxides, and it does not require the use of harsh chemicals or heat.\n\n"}, {"question": "The antiepileptic action of vigabatrin (gamma-vinylGABA) is due to:", "correct_answer": "It is a suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)It is a suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase.", "B)It is a GABA receptor agonist.", "C)It is a hard analog of GABA.", "D)It is a prodrug of GABA."], "prompt": "The antiepileptic action of vigabatrin (gamma-vinylGABA) is due to:A)It is a suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase.\nB)It is a GABA receptor agonist.\nC)It is a hard analog of GABA.\nD)It is a prodrug of GABA.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic drug that works by inhibiting the enzyme GABA transaminase, which is responsible for the degradation of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) in the brain. By inhibiting this enzyme, vigabatrin increases the levels of GABA in the brain, leading to a decrease in the frequency of seizures.\n\n", "output1": "Vigabatrin works by activating GABA receptors, which are the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. By activating these receptors, vigabatrin increases the activity of GABA, leading to a decrease in the activity of neurons and a reduction in seizure activity.\n\n", "output2": "Vigabatrin is a hard analog of GABA, which means that it is structurally similar to GABA but has a different chemical properties. This makes it difficult for the body to break down vigabatrin, allowing it to remain in the system for a longer period of time and exert its therapeutic effects.\n\n", "output3": "Vigabatrin is a prodrug of GABA, meaning that it is converted into GABA in the body. This conversion is done by the enzyme GABA transaminase, which is inhibited by vigabatrin. By inhibiting this enzyme, vigabatrin increases the amount of GABA available for use by the brain, which can help to reduce seizures.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of pain and weakness in her left leg that started 2 days ago while running a marathon.
