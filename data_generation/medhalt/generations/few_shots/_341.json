Resistance to sulfonamide antibiotics is often caused by the production of thymidine analogues, such as sulfonamide-resistant bacteria. These bacteria are able to synthesize DNA using thymidine analogues, which makes them resistant to sulfonamide antibiotics.\n\n", "output2": "Thymidine is a nucleoside that is involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA.
