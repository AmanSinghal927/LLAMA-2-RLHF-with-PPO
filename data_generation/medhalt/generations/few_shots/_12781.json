As the number of dentinal tubules increases, the size of the odontoblastic layer cells also increases.\n\n", "output1": "The odontoblastic layer is a specialized layer of cells that line the dentinal tubules in the crown of the tooth. The cells in this layer are tall and columnar in shape, which allows them to produce a hard, tough dentin that is resistant to decay and damage.\n\n", "output2": "The odontoblastic layer is composed of squamous cells in the apical portion of the tooth. These cells are larger in size and are responsible for the production of dentin. The number of dentinal tubules does not directly affect the size of the odontoblastic cells.\n\n", "output3": "The odontoblastic layer, which is the layer of cells that produce dentin, has different cell sizes depending on the location in the tooth.
