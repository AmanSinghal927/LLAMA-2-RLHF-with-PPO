Abrasion wounds are characterized by the removal of the epidermis and the exposure of the underlying tissue. The other options, contusion, laceration, and incision, are all types of wounds that involve the dermis.\n\n", "output1": "A contusion is a type of wound that does not involve the dermis, the layer of skin beneath the epidermis. It is characterized by a bruise or swelling caused by a blow to the skin.\n\n", "output2": "A laceration is a type of wound that does not involve the dermis, the layer of skin beneath the epidermis. It is a superficial wound that only affects the epidermis and the outer layer of the skin.\n\n", "output3": "An incision is a type of wound that does not involve the dermis, which is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis. Incisions are typically made with a sharp object, such as a scalpel, and are often used to remove tissue or to make a cut for a surgical procedure.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for evaluation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes.

The effacement of podocytes on electron microscopy is a characteristic feature of minimal change disease.\n\n", "output1": "The presence of fatty casts and albumin in the urine is consistent with the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, which is a kidney disease that can cause periorbital edema and pitting edema. The effacement of podocytes on electron microscopy is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The presence of white blood cell casts and eosinophils in urine is a common finding in patients with allergic or immunological disorders, such as allergic nephropathy.

Therefore, it is unlikely to contain bacteria.\n\n", "output1": "Bile ratio chronic cholecystitis cultured bacteria higher than acute cholecystitis is incorrect because chronic cholecystitis is a chronic inflammatory condition, and the bile is not sterile. In fact, the bile in chronic cholecystitis is more likely to be colonized with bacteria, which can contribute to the development of infection and inflammation.\n\n", "output2": "Bile is sterile in the absence of gallstones or other lesions, so the bile of patients with symptoms of gallstones is likely to be contaminated with bacteria. E. coli and Klebsiella are common Gram-negative bacteria that are often found in the bile of patients with gallstones.\n\n", "output3": "The bile in the gallbladder is generally sterile, and the bile duct stones are not a common site of infection.

This is because the tubal muscles are the weakest at this point, making it easier for the fertilized egg to implant outside of the uterus.\n\n", "output2": "The answer is C) Salpingitis produces least crypts here. Ectopic pregnancy is most common at the ampulla of the fallopian tube, and salpingitis (inflammation of the fallopian tube) produces the least number of crypts in this area.\n\n", "output3": "Ectopic pregnancies are most commonly found at the ampulla of the fallopian tube, which is the widest part of the tube. This is because the plicae, or folds, in the ampulla provide a more favorable environment for the implantation of the fertilized egg.

However, the linear structure of these polymers inhibits the formation of crystalline regions, resulting in a predominantly amorphous structure.\n\n", "output1": "The linear dental polymers are predominantly crystalline with little or no amorphous structure. This means that they have a highly ordered crystalline structure, with little or no disorder or randomness.\n\n", "output2": "Linear dental polymers are typically crystalline in nature, meaning that they have a well-defined crystal structure. This is because they are synthesized through a process called polymerization, which involves the repetitive linking of monomer units to form a long chain. As a result, linear dental polymers tend to be highly crystalline, with little or no amorphous structure.\n\n", "output3": "Linear dental polymers are typically amorphous, meaning they have no crystalline structure. This is because the molecules in these materials are too large and complex to form a crystalline lattice. As a result, linear dental polymers are always completely amorphous.\n\n"}, {"question": "Downward and outward moment of eye is effected in injury of?", "correct_answer": "4th nerve", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)3rd nerve", "B)4th nerve", "C)5th nerve", "D)6th nerve"], "prompt": "Downward and outward moment of eye is effected in injury of?A)3rd nerve\nB)4th nerve\nC)5th nerve\nD)6th nerve", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "output0": "The 3rd cranial nerve is responsible for controlling the downward and outward movement of the eye.
