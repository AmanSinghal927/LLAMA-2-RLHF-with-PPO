When this muscle contracts excessively or spasms, it can cause the articular disc to be displaced beyond the articular tubercle, leading to dislocation of the jaw.\n\n", "output3": "Displacement of the articular disc beyond the articular tubercle of the temporomandibular joint in dislocation of the jaw is often caused by spasm or excessive contraction of the temporalis muscle. This muscle is located on the side of the head and helps to move the jaw forward and backward. When the temporalis muscle contracts too strongly, it can push the articular disc out of its normal position and cause dislocation of the jaw.\n\n"}, {"question": "A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours.
