This is due to the weakened immune system caused by HIV, which makes it more difficult for the body to fight off infections.\n\n", "output1": "The most common oral infection in HIV is Streptococcus. This is because HIV can weaken the immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight off infections. Streptococcus is a type of bacteria that can cause a variety of infections, including strep throat and tooth decay.\n\n", "output2": "The most common oral infection in HIV is Staphylococcus aureus. This is because the immune system of HIV-infected individuals is weakened, making them more susceptible to opportunistic infections such as staphylococcal infections.\n\n", "output3": "Tuberculosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, particularly those with advanced disease. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and can affect various parts of the body, including the lungs, brain, and kidneys.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is a X linked metabolic disorder?", "correct_answer": "Fabry's disease", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Fabry's disease", "B)Sandoff s disease", "C)Pompe disease", "D)Gaucher disease"], "prompt": "Which of the following is a X linked metabolic disorder?A)Fabry's disease\nB)Sandoff s disease\nC)Pompe disease\nD)Gaucher disease", "subject_name": "Pediatrics", "output0": "Fabry's disease is a X-linked metabolic disorder, meaning that the gene that causes the disease is located on the X chromosome. This means that the disease is more common in males, who have only one X chromosome, as they do not have a second X chromosome to compensate for the mutated gene. Females, who have two X chromosomes, are less likely to be affected by the disease, but may still be carriers.\n\n", "output1": "Sandoff's disease is a X-linked metabolic disorder, meaning that it is caused by a mutation in a gene located on the X chromosome. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme acid ceramidase, which leads to the accumulation of ceramides in the body.\n\n", "output2": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This enzyme is encoded by the GAA gene, which is located on the X chromosome. As a result, Pompe disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.\n\n", "output3": "Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is encoded by the GBA gene, which is located on the X chromosome. As a result, Gaucher disease is X linked, meaning that it is more common in males, who have only one X chromosome, than in females, who have two X chromosomes.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following are not a branch of external carotid Aery in Kiesselbach's plexus.", "correct_answer": "Anterior ethmoidal aery", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Sphenopalatine aery", "B)Anterior ethmoidal aery", "C)Greater palatine aery", "D)Septal branch of superior labial aery"], "prompt": "Which of the following are not a branch of external carotid Aery in Kiesselbach's plexus.A)Sphenopalatine aery\nB)Anterior ethmoidal aery\nC)Greater palatine aery\nD)Septal branch of superior labial aery", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "output0": "Sphenopalatine aery is not a branch of the external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus.

This is because more theoretical plates provide more opportunities for the solutes to interact with the stationary phase and be separated.\n\n", "output1": "The height of the theoretical plates is a critical factor in the separation of solutes using a chromatographic column. Increasing the height of the column allows for a greater distance for the solutes to travel, which results in better separation.\n\n", "output2": "The effectiveness of a chromatographic column to separate two solutes increases when the width of the chromatographic peaks of the solutes increases. This is because a wider peak means that the solutes are more distinct and can be separated more easily.\n\n", "output3": "The effectiveness of a chromatographic column to separate two solutes increases by decreasing the length of the column filling because a shorter column will have a lower volume of solvent, which will allow for more efficient separation of the solutes.\n\n"}, {"question": "Hemodynamically unstable patient with SVT", "correct_answer": "CARDIOVERSION", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)IV IBUTILIDE", "B)IV DILTIAZEM", "C)CARDIOVERSION", "D)Iv beta-blockers"], "prompt": "Hemodynamically unstable patient with SVTA)IV IBUTILIDE\nB)IV DILTIAZEM\nC)CARDIOVERSION\nD)Iv beta-blockers", "subject_name": "Medicine", "output0": "IV ibutilide is the most appropriate treatment for a hemodynamically unstable patient with SVT. It is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that can rapidly convert the patient's tachycardia to a normal sinus rhythm.\n\n", "output1": "IV diltiazem is the preferred medication for hemodynamically unstable patients with SVT, as it has a rapid onset of action and can effectively control the ventricular rate. In contrast, IV beta-blockers (such as propranolol) may take longer to take effect and may not be as effective in controlling the ventricular rate. Cardioversion is not a medication, but rather a procedure that is used to restore a normal heart rhythm. IV ibutilide is not typically used for SVT, as it is primarily used for atrial fibrillation.\n\n", "output2": "The Turtle Technique is not a medical procedure, but rather a technique used to help children develop better self-control and emotional regulation skills.

This is due to the fact that men have a shorter and more intense sexual response cycle than women, which makes it more difficult for them to achieve orgasm.\n\n", "output2": "Anorgasmia, or the inability to achieve orgasm, is a common issue for both men and women. It is not more common in one gender than the other. In fact, studies suggest that anorgasmia affects approximately 10-20% of men and 25-30% of women.\n\n", "output3": "Anorgasmia is more common in men than in women. This is because men tend to have a more straightforward sexual response cycle, and orgasm is the final step in this cycle. Women, on the other hand, have a more complex sexual response cycle, and orgasm is not the only goal of their sexual experience.\n\n"}, {"question": "Extra retinal fibrovascular proliferation at ridge is?", "correct_answer": "Stage III ROM", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Normal", "B)Stage I ROM", "C)Stage II ROM", "D)Stage III ROM"], "prompt": "Extra retinal fibrovascular proliferation at ridge is?A)Normal\nB)Stage I ROM\nC)Stage II ROM\nD)Stage III ROM", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "output0": "Extra retinal fibrovascular proliferation at the ridge is a normal finding in children.
