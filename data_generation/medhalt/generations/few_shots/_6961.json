This is because meconium aspiration is a common cause of respiratory distress in newborns, and it can cause a diffuse ground glass appearance on chest radiographs.

This condition occurs when the pulmonary veins do not properly connect to the left atrium, resulting in a diffuse ground glass appearance on the chest radiograph and hypoxemia. The negative result of surfactant replacement and the presence of a term female sibling who died of respiratory distress at 1 month of age suggest that the underlying cause of the infant's respiratory distress is likely related to a congenital heart defect, rather than a respiratory or infectious disorder.\n\n", "output3": "The most likely diagnosis for the described infant is disseminated herpes simplex infection.
