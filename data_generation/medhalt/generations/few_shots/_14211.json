This structure allows for the efficient transfer of nutrients and waste products within the colony.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows slowly. This is because mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis, are slow-growing organisms.\n\n", "output3": "Photochromogenic mycobacteria are those that produce pigments in response to light, while scotocromogens produce pigments in the absence of light. This difference in pigment production is due to the presence of light-sensitive molecules called photoreceptors, which are present in photochromogenic mycobacteria but not in scotocromogens.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following vessel is not ligated in case of epistaxis control?", "correct_answer": "Internal carotid aery", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Maxillary aery", "B)Anterior ethmoidal aery", "C)Internal carotid aery", "D)External carotid aery"], "prompt": "Which of the following vessel is not ligated in case of epistaxis control?A)Maxillary aery\nB)Anterior ethmoidal aery\nC)Internal carotid aery\nD)External carotid aery", "subject_name": "ENT", "output0": "The maxillary artery is not ligated in case of epistaxis control because it is not directly involved in the bleeding.
