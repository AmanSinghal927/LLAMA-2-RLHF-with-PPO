This is an essential effect for the excretion of urine with osmolarity different from that of plasma.\n\n", "output1": "The reabsorption of bicarbonate in the nephron is mainly performed in the distal convoluted tubule because it is the most specialized tubular segment for the process. The distal convoluted tubule has a high concentration of bicarbonate-specific transport proteins, such as the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE3), which facilitates the reabsorption of bicarbonate back into the blood.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is that the urinary excretion of Na and water is equal to the sum of the amount filtered through the glomeruli and the amount reabsorbed by the tubules. This is because the glomeruli filter the entire blood volume and the tubules reabsorb most of the filtered substances, including Na and water. The amount excreted in the urine is therefore equal to the difference between the amount filtered and the amount reabsorbed.\n\n", "output3": "Under normal conditions, the proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs most of the filtered glucose (about 80%) and returns it to the systemic circulation through the peritubular capillaries. This process is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels within a narrow range.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 21-year-old man comes to the physician because of nervousness and difficulty sleeping over the past 2 weeks.
