This can occur in cases of maternal Graves' disease, as in this case. These antibodies can cause hypothyroidism in the baby, leading to poor weight gain and other symptoms.\n\n", "output1": "Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies is the most likely cause of the newborn's symptoms. The mother's history of Graves' disease and the fact that she underwent near-total thyroidectomy during pregnancy suggest that she has high levels of TSH receptor antibodies. These antibodies can cross the placenta and affect the newborn's thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism and the symptoms seen in the newborn.\n\n", "output2": "Transplacental viral infection is the most likely cause of the newborn's poor weight gain and irritability. The swelling of the neck at the midline suggests a possible congenital infection, which could be caused by a virus that was transmitted to the baby during pregnancy. The mother's history of Graves' disease and thyroidectomy may also contribute to the baby's poor weight gain and hypothyroidism.\n\n", "output3": "The most likely cause of the newborn's poor weight gain and irritability is opiate use in the mother. Opiate use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is characterized by poor feeding, irritability, and tremors. The swelling of the neck at the midline is also consistent with NAS.

It originates from the pelvic bone and sacrum and inserts into the coccyx. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus are components. The levator ani muscle is a complex of muscles that support the pelvic floor, but the pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus muscles are not components of the levator ani muscle.\n\n", "output2": "Levator ani muscle fibers are directed superior and lateral, not posterior and medial.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Suppos pelvic viscera because the levator ani muscle does not have any attachments to the pelvic viscera.
