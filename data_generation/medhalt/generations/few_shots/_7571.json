This means that the upper and lower teeth should not rotate or twist when biting down. This key is important for maintaining proper occlusion and preventing issues such as TMJ dysfunction and tooth wear.\n\n", "output1": "The 5th key of Andrews six keys of occlusion is Mesio distal crown angulation. This key is important because it helps to align the teeth in a way that allows for proper occlusion and prevents issues such as excessive wear on the teeth.\n\n", "output2": "The fifth key of Andrews six keys of occlusion is Tight contacts. This refers to the contact between the upper and lower teeth, which should be tight but not so tight that it causes discomfort or pain.
