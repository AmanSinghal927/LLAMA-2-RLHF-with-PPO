This is due to the fact that the aortic valve is severely stenotic, which causes the blood to flow through the valve in a turbulent manner, producing two distinct sounds.\n\n", "output1": "In severe AS, there is a late ejection systolic click, which is an abnormal sound that occurs due to the late closure of the aortic valve. This sound can be heard as a late systolic click, and it is a characteristic feature of severe AS.\n\n", "output2": "A heaving shifted apex is a characteristic feature of severe AS, which is often seen in children with this condition. This is caused by the increased pressure in the right atrium, which pushes the apex of the heart to the left side of the chest.\n\n", "output3": "In severe AS, there is a loud S2 sound due to the increased pressure in the left ventricle.
