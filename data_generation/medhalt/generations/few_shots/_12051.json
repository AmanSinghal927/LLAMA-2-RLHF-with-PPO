This is important for drugs that need to be transported across the cell membrane to be effective.\n\n", "output2": "Drug transport across the cell membrane is mainly by facilitated diffusion, which is a type of transport that involves the movement of molecules through the cell membrane with the help of a carrier protein. This process is more efficient than simple diffusion and is often used to transport drugs into the cell.\n\n", "output3": "Drug transport across the cell membrane is mainly by pinocytosis because it is a process that allows cells to take in and internalize substances from the extracellular fluid, including drugs.

If a patient experiences both diarrhea and constipation, it is more likely that the symptoms are caused by another condition, and IBS can be ruled out.\n\n", "output3": "In patients with irritable bowel syndrome with predominance of diarrhea, it is important to perform a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms.

The murmur is likely due to a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is a common congenital heart defect that can close on its own within the first few years of life.
