This is based on the patient's irritability, restlessness, and agitation, which are all common symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Additionally, the patient's pupils being equal and reactive to light is also consistent with alcohol use. The other options, cocaine, diphenhydramine, and haloperidol, are not likely to cause these symptoms.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's symptoms of agitation, irritability, and restlessness, as well as his history of schizophrenia, are consistent with the effects of cocaine use. Cocaine is a stimulant that can cause agitation, aggression, and psychotic symptoms in some individuals, particularly those with a history of psychiatric disorders. The patient's recent attempt to steal from a grocery store and his statement that he wants to kill himself are also consistent with the effects of cocaine use.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of agitation, restlessness, and irritability are consistent with diphenhydramine toxicity. Diphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine that can cause agitation, confusion, and hallucinations at high doses.

Additionally, the patient's recent office note from his primary care doctor for treatment of seasonal allergies is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n", "output3": "The most likely substance used by this patient is Haloperidol, as it is a medication commonly used to treat psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. The patient's symptoms of agitation, irritability, and combativeness, along with his recent history of schizophrenia, are consistent with the adverse effects of this medication. Additionally, the patient's dilated pupils and spontaneous movement of all limbs are also consistent with the effects of Haloperidol.\n\n"}, {"question": "What is NOT a major criteria for Rheumatic heart disease \u2013", "correct_answer": "Raised ASLO titer", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Arthritis", "B)Carditis", "C)Subcutaneous nodule", "D)Raised ASLO titer"], "prompt": "What is NOT a major criteria for Rheumatic heart disease \u2013A)Arthritis\nB)Carditis\nC)Subcutaneous nodule\nD)Raised ASLO titer", "subject_name": "Pediatrics", "output0": "Arthritis is not a major criteria for Rheumatic heart disease.
