This is because the mandibular incisors are the most common teeth to have a single apical foramen.\n\n", "output1": "According to various studies, approximately 82.5% of mandibular incisors have a single apical foramen. This means that in almost 83 out of 100 cases, the mandibular incisors will have only one apical foramen.\n\n", "output2": "According to the literature, approximately 60% of mandibular incisors have a single apical foramen. This is based on a study of 1000 teeth.\n\n", "output3": "According to various studies, the prevalence of single apical foramen in mandibular incisors ranges from 60% to 78%. This is because the formation of the foramen is influenced by several factors, such as the size and shape of the tooth, the position of the roots, and the presence of dental restorations.\n\n"}, {"question": "Study of person to person inter-relationship in a society -Economics", "correct_answer": "Suciology", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Economics", "B)Suciology", "C)Psychology", "D)Anthropology"], "prompt": "Study of person to person inter-relationship in a society -EconomicsA)Economics\nB)Suciology\nC)Psychology\nD)Anthropology", "subject_name": "Social & Preventive Medicine", "output0": "The study of person-to-person inter-relationship in a society is an important aspect of economics, as it deals with the interactions between individuals and the impact of these interactions on the economy.
