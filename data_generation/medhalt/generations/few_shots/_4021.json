This is because bone buttressing can provide additional support to the fracture and help to maintain the reduction, making it possible to achieve stable fixation with a less invasive approach.\n\n", "output1": "The AO system of fixation is a type of load bearing fixation that utilizes a combination of screws and plates to provide stability to the bone while allowing for the bone to heal. When adequate bone buttressing is present, this type of fixation is recommended to ensure proper healing and prevent further damage to the bone.\n\n", "output2": "When adequate bone buttressing is present, the AO system of fixation suggests load sharing fixation, which distributes the weight-bearing forces across multiple points, reducing the stress on any one point and minimizing the risk of implant failure.\n\n", "output3": "The AO system of fixation is designed to provide non-rigid fixation, which allows for the natural movement of the bone and promotes the formation of new bone tissue. When adequate bone buttressing is present, the AO system can be used to provide load sharing fixation, which helps to distribute the weight-bearing forces across the bone and prevents excessive stress on the fixation device.\n\n"}, {"question": "ST Segment of ECG corresponds to which phase of action potential ?", "correct_answer": "Phase II", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Phase 0", "B)Phase I", "C)Phase II", "D)Phase III"], "prompt": "ST Segment of ECG corresponds to which phase of action potential ?A)Phase 0\nB)Phase I\nC)Phase II\nD)Phase III", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "The ST segment of an ECG corresponds to the phase 0 of the action potential.
