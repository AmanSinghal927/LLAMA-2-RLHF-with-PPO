Factors such as biological differences, occupation and socialization patterns, and environmental factors can all contribute to gender-related differences and inequalities in health.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Occupation and socialization patterns. Gender-related differences and inequalities in health cannot be explained by these factors because they are not specific to one gender and are not linked to biological differences between males and females.\n\n", "output3": "Environmental factors such as pollution, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare are not the cause of gender-related differences and inequalities in health.

The RMP is the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane when the cell is at rest and not actively contracting.\n\n", "output1": "The resting membrane potential (RMP) in smooth muscles is typically around 70 mV. This is because smooth muscles are not as excitable as other types of muscles, and therefore do not require as high of an RMP to function properly.\n\n", "output2": "The resting membrane potential (RMP) in smooth muscles is typically around 150 mV. This is because smooth muscles are non-excitable tissues that do not have the ability to generate action potentials. As a result, the RMP in smooth muscles is more negative than in other types of tissues.\n\n", "output3": "The resting membrane potential (RMP) in smooth muscles is typically around -40 mV. This is because smooth muscle cells have a high concentration of sodium channels, which allow sodium ions to enter the cell and depolarize it.

It is commonly used in the diagnosis of hemophilia, bone marrow transplantation, and infections caused by opportunistic pathogens.
