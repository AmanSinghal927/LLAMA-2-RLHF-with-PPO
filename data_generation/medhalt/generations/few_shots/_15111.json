They are a normal part of dental development and are not a pathological condition. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n", "output1": "The Turtle Technique is a method used to help children in the last courses of Primary Education develop better self-control and emotional regulation skills. It is not a treatment for physiological issues such as dental development, but rather a way to address behavioral issues. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Incisal liability is not a term used in dentistry, so option C is also incorrect.\n\n", "output2": "Incisal liability is a common issue in deciduous dentition, and it can be a sign of a more serious problem, such as malocclusion or poor oral hygiene. Therefore, it is important to monitor and address this issue in children to prevent more serious problems from developing.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)none of above because spaces in deciduous dentition are not a pathological condition, but rather a normal and physiological variation in the development of the teeth.\n\n"}, {"question": "High molecular weight proteins in cataractous lens seen only in humans:", "correct_answer": "HM 3 and 4", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)HM 1 and 2", "B)HM 2 and 3", "C)HM 2 and 4", "D)HM 3 and 4"], "prompt": "High molecular weight proteins in cataractous lens seen only in humans:A)HM 1 and 2\nB)HM 2 and 3\nC)HM 2 and 4\nD)HM 3 and 4", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "output0": "HM 1 and 2 are the only two high molecular weight proteins that have been found in cataractous lenses of humans.

This can cause an increase in the production of melanin, which can lead to darkening of the skin. Thinness is a common symptom of growth hormone excess, so the two conditions are often linked.\n\n", "output1": "Acanthosis nigricans is a condition characterized by the overgrowth of the skin, which can be caused by a number of factors, including hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Children with hypoglycemia may experience a rapid drop in blood sugar levels, which can lead to the development of acanthosis nigricans.\n\n", "output2": "Acanthosis nigricans is a condition characterized by the overgrowth of skin cells, which can cause the skin to appear darker. This condition is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty. White breast is a symptom of acanthosis nigricans, and it is often seen in women with this condition.\n\n", "output3": "Acanthosis nigricans is often associated with anovulatory menstrual cycles. This is due to the increased production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which can cause the skin to become darker and more velvety.\n\n"}, {"question": "According to Howe, to achieve a normal occlusion with full complement of teeth, the basal arch width at the premolar region should be _____of the sum of the mesiodistal widths of all the teeth mesial to the second molar.", "correct_answer": "44%", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)37%", "B)29%", "C)44%", "D)40%"], "prompt": "According to Howe, to achieve a normal occlusion with full complement of teeth, the basal arch width at the premolar region should be _____of the sum of the mesiodistal widths of all the teeth mesial to the second molar.A)37%\nB)29%\nC)44%\nD)40%", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "According to Howe, the basal arch width at the premolar region should be approximately 37% of the sum of the mesiodistal widths of all the teeth mesial to the second molar to achieve a normal occlusion with a full complement of teeth.
