The test measures the difference in electrical potential across the epithelial cells of the nasal passages, which is affected in cystic fibrosis. The normal result is a negative value, but in cystic fibrosis, the value is usually positive.\n\n", "output1": "The presence of clubbing of the nail bed, which is a characteristic of cystic fibrosis, along with the family history of a distant cousin with cystic fibrosis, suggests that the patient may have cystic fibrosis. A skeletal survey would be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis by looking for characteristic changes in the bones.\n\n", "output2": "A complete blood cell count (CBC) would be helpful in establishing a diagnosis for the 4-year-old girl with recurrent sinusitis, otitis media, and clubbing of the nail bed. This test can help identify if there is an underlying blood disorder, such as cystic fibrosis, that may be contributing to her symptoms. The normal result of the sweat test does not rule out the possibility of cystic fibrosis, and a CBC can provide additional information to support or rule out this diagnosis.\n\n", "output3": "Urinalysis would be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in this patient. The presence of abnormal urinary findings, such as excessive urinary sodium and chloride, would support the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
