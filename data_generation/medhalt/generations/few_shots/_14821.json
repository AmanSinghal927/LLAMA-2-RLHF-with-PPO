This enzyme specifically targets and breaks the disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in globular proteins.\n\n", "output2": "Protein disulfide bridge bonds are important for maintaining the primary structure of globular proteins. They are formed by the oxidation of two cysteine residues, which results in the formation of a disulfide bond between them. This bond helps to stabilize the protein structure and prevent misfolding.\n\n", "output3": "Protein disulfide bridge bonds are weak bonds that can be broken by exposure to high concentrations of urea. Dialysis, which involves the use of urea to separate proteins from other components of blood, can cause the rupture of these bonds.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is used for selecting patients with respect to potential factors that will affect the results?", "correct_answer": "Stratified random sampling", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Systematic random sampling", "B)Simple random sampling", "C)Stratified random sampling", "D)Cluster sampling"], "prompt": "Which of the following is used for selecting patients with respect to potential factors that will affect the results?A)Systematic random sampling\nB)Simple random sampling\nC)Stratified random sampling\nD)Cluster sampling", "subject_name": "Social & Preventive Medicine", "output0": "Systematic random sampling is used to select patients for the Turtle Technique in order to minimize potential biases and ensure that the sample is representative of the target population.
