This is because postprandial glucose levels provide an indication of how well the body is able to regulate blood sugar levels after consuming a meal.\n\n", "output1": "Postprandial capillary glucose should be < 140 mg / dl for adequate diabetes control. This is because high postprandial glucose levels can indicate poor blood sugar control and increase the risk of long-term complications.\n\n", "output2": "The American Diabetes Association recommends that postprandial (after meal) capillary glucose levels should be less than 180 mg/dl for adequate diabetes control. This is because postprandial glucose control is an important factor in preventing long-term complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease and kidney damage.\n\n", "output3": "Post prandial capillary glucose should be < 200 mg/dl for adequate diabetes control. This is because a post prandial glucose level of < 200 mg/dl is considered a normal range for individuals with diabetes, and is a good indicator of diabetes control.\n\n"}, {"question": "The nutrient aery to the femur is?", "correct_answer": "Profunda femoris aery", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Profunda femoris aery", "B)Femoral aery", "C)Popliteal aery", "D)Middle circumflex femoral aery"], "prompt": "The nutrient aery to the femur is?A)Profunda femoris aery\nB)Femoral aery\nC)Popliteal aery\nD)Middle circumflex femoral aery", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "output0": "The Profunda femoris aery is the nutrient artery that supplies blood to the femur.

This time frame is long enough to allow the fluoride to penetrate the tooth enamel and help prevent further demineralization, but short enough to minimize the risk of over-etching.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)15-30 sec because fluorosis is a condition where there is an excessive amount of fluoride in the tooth enamel, which can cause white or brown spots to appear. These spots are more resistant to etching than healthy tooth enamel, so it takes longer to etch them.\n\n", "output2": "Fluorosed teeth require more time to be etched compared to non-fluorosed teeth.
