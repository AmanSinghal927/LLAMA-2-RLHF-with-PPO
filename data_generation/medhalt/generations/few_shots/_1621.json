This enzyme is responsible for converting hypoxanthine and guanine into purine nucleotides, which are essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA.

The patient\u2019s history of long-term use of allopurinol, a medication that inhibits the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), is likely the cause of the hyperuricemia. HGPRT is responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine and guanine to their corresponding nucleotides, which are essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA.
