It is characterized by a high concentration of dentinal tubules, which can provide a pathway for bacteria to enter the tooth and cause decay.\n\n", "output1": "Sclerotic dentin is a type of dentin that is less sensitive due to the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals. This makes it less sensitive to pain and temperature changes, which is why it is often associated with dental caries.\n\n", "output2": "The sclerotic dentin layer is hypersensitive because it is composed of a high percentage of dentin tubules that are exposed due to the loss of the enamel layer. This makes the dentin more susceptible to sensations such as pain and temperature changes.\n\n", "output3": "Sclerotic dentin is a type of dentin that is more resistant to caries due to its high mineral content. This makes it less susceptible to decay and more resistant to acid attacks.\n\n"}, {"question": "If the mother has varicella infection during pregnancy, when is there a greater risk of the child developing varicella fulminans ?:", "correct_answer": "When the infection occurs between 5 days before delivery and 2 days after delivery.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)When the infection occurs between the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.", "B)When the infection occurs between the second trimester and the 21 days prior to delivery.", "C)When the infection occurs between 20 and 6 days before delivery.", "D)When the infection occurs between 5 days before delivery and 2 days after delivery."], "prompt": "If the mother has varicella infection during pregnancy, when is there a greater risk of the child developing varicella fulminans ?:A)When the infection occurs between the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.\nB)When the infection occurs between the second trimester and the 21 days prior to delivery.\nC)When the infection occurs between 20 and 6 days before delivery.\nD)When the infection occurs between 5 days before delivery and 2 days after delivery.", "subject_name": "nursery", "output0": "There is a greater risk of the child developing varicella fulminans when the mother has a varicella infection during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.

Berkson's bias, also known as the admission rate bias, occurs when the admission rate to a hospital is related to the exposure of interest. In this case, the cardiologist's study is susceptible to Berkson's bias because the patients in the control group were all admitted to the same ward as the cases, which may have influenced the results.
