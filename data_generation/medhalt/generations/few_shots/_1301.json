It is the most sensitive and specific test for detecting abnormal cells in the cervix, which is the site of most postmenopausal bleeding.\n\n", "output1": "Laparoscopy is the investigation of choice in postmenopausal bleeding because it allows for a visual inspection of the uterus and any potential causes of bleeding, such as fibroids or endometrial polyps. Additionally, it is a minimally invasive procedure, which reduces the risk of complications and allows for a faster recovery time.\n\n", "output2": "Fractional curettage is the most appropriate choice for investigating postmenopausal bleeding. This minimally invasive procedure allows for the removal of tissue samples from the uterus, which can then be examined for any abnormal cells or lesions.\n\n", "output3": "Ultrasound is the investigation of choice for postmenopausal bleeding because it is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive test that can help identify the source of the bleeding. It can also provide important information about the uterus, such as its size and shape, and can help rule out other potential causes of bleeding.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of these phrases about gluconeogenesis is NOT true ?:", "correct_answer": "Gluconeogenesis has as main substrates lactate, amino acids, propionate and acetyl-CoA.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Gluconeogenesis is the production of new glucose.", "B)Gluconeogenesis has as main substrates lactate, amino acids, propionate and acetyl-CoA.", "C)Gluconeogenesis uses some enzymatic reactions different from those of glycolysis.", "D)Gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the cytosol."], "prompt": "Which of these phrases about gluconeogenesis is NOT true ?:A)Gluconeogenesis is the production of new glucose.\nB)Gluconeogenesis has as main substrates lactate, amino acids, propionate and acetyl-CoA.\nC)Gluconeogenesis uses some enzymatic reactions different from those of glycolysis.\nD)Gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the cytosol.", "subject_name": "chemistry", "output0": "Gluconeogenesis is the process by which the body produces new glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, amino acids, and glycerol.
