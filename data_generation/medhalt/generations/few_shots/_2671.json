The use of two indicator electrodes of the same nature would not provide a reliable reference point for the measurement, as they would be subject to the same changes in potential due to the reaction. Therefore, only potentiometric titrations at i = 0, where i is the current intensity, can be carried out using two indicator electrodes of the same nature.\n\n", "output1": "Yes, potentiometric titrations can be carried out at constant intensity using two indicator electrodes of the same nature.
