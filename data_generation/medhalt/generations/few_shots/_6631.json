Pulmonic stenosis is a congenital heart defect that results in narrowing of the pulmonary valve, leading to increased pressure in the right ventricle and left atrium, and causing the heart to enlarge.\n\n", "output1": "The structural changes in the heart described in the patient's autopsy report, such as dilatation of the left atrium and expansion of the left ventricular cavity with associated eccentric hypertrophy, are most likely associated with mitral insufficiency. This is because these changes are consistent with the long-standing elevated left atrial pressure that occurs in mitral insufficiency, which can lead to enlargement of the heart chambers and hypertrophy of the heart muscle.\n\n", "output2": "The structural changes in the heart described in the patient's autopsy, including dilatation of the left atrium and expansion of the left ventricular cavity with associated eccentric hypertrophy, are consistent with chronic hypertension.
