Additionally, acetylene gas is a more efficient fuel source than propane or butane, which means that it produces more heat per unit of fuel consumed.\n\n", "output1": "Propane is the best gas to use in the torch for melting the alloy while avoiding burnout because it has a lower flame temperature than acetylene and produces less heat. This reduces the risk of overheating the alloy and causing it to become brittle or deformed.\n\n", "output2": "Butane is the best gas for melting alloy while preventing burnout because it has a low flame temperature and a high heat output. This makes it an ideal gas for melting and shaping metal alloys without causing damage or overheating.\n\n", "output3": "Ethylene gas is the best choice for melting the alloy while preventing burnout because it has a lower flame temperature than the other options.
