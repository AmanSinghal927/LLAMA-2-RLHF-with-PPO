Specifically, barbiturates have been linked to an increased risk of cardiac malformations, such as ventricular septal defects and atrial septal defects. This risk is thought to be due to the fact that barbiturates can cross the placenta and reach the fetus, where they can interfere with normal fetal development.\n\n", "output1": "Valproate is associated with causing congenital heart disease in fetuses. This is because valproate can cross the placenta and reach the developing fetus, where it can affect the development of the heart and other organs.\n\n", "output2": "Carbamazepine is associated with causing congenital heart disease in fetuses when taken during pregnancy. This is because the drug can cross the placenta and affect the developing heart of the fetus.\n\n", "output3": "Phenytoin is associated with a risk of causing congenital heart disease in the fetus.
