Atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis are two different conditions, and they should not be confused. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is often associated with allergies and an overactive immune system, while seborrheic dermatitis is a condition that is caused by an overgrowth of fungus on the skin.\n\n", "output3": "Topical steroids are often prescribed to treat infant atopic dermatitis, but they can have side effects, such as skin thinning and increased risk of infection.
