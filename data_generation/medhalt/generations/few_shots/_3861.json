It is the most easily metabolized energy source and is the preferred energy source for brain function.\n\n", "output1": "Ketone bodies are an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is not available. During periods of fasting or low-carbohydrate diets, the brain can switch to using ketone bodies as a primary source of energy, which can improve cognitive function and memory.\n\n", "output2": "When the brain is deprived of glucose, it can use ketone bodies as an alternative source of energy. However, the brain prefers to use fatty acids as an alternate fuel source. This is because fatty acids can be easily broken down into smaller molecules that can be used by the brain.\n\n", "output3": "Amino acids are an important source of energy for the brain, especially during times of low glucose availability. They can be used as an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is not available or when the body is in a state of ketosis.\n\n"}, {"question": "Regarding daptomycin, which of the following statements is true ?:", "correct_answer": "It is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)It has activity against gram-negative bacteria.", "B)It can be administered orally.", "C)It is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant.", "D)It presents adverse reactions at the bone level."], "prompt": "Regarding daptomycin, which of the following statements is true ?:A)It has activity against gram-negative bacteria.\nB)It can be administered orally.\nC)It is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant.\nD)It presents adverse reactions at the bone level.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "Daptomycin is an antibiotic that is active against gram-negative bacteria.
