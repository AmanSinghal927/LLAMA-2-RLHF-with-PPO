Trifluoromethylbenzene has the highest electronegativity, followed by benzene, and then toluene. Therefore, the order of the speed of nitration is: trifluoromethylbenzene> toluene> benzene.\n\n", "output1": "The order of the speed of nitration of these compounds is determined by the electronegativity of the substituents and the reactivity of the benzene ring. Benzene has a high electronegativity and is more reactive than toluene and trifluoromethylbenzene, which have lower electronegativity and are less reactive. Therefore, benzene is the first to undergo nitration, followed by toluene, and then trifluoromethylbenzene.\n\n", "output2": "The order of nitration of the compounds follows the order of their electronegativity, with the highest electronegative atom (trifluoromethyl) being the first to react. Therefore, trifluoromethylbenzene is the first to react, followed by toluene, and then benzene.\n\n", "output3": "The speed of nitration of a compound is influenced by the electronegativity of the substituents. Trifluoromethyl groups are highly electronegative, which means that they withdraw electrons away from the benzene ring. This results in a faster nitration reaction.\n\n"}, {"question": "Most common risk factor for rupture of scarred uterus is", "correct_answer": "Use of oxytocin in labour", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Use of oxytocin in labour", "B)Grand multiparity", "C)Forceps application", "D)Obstructed labour"], "prompt": "Most common risk factor for rupture of scarred uterus isA)Use of oxytocin in labour\nB)Grand multiparity\nC)Forceps application\nD)Obstructed labour", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The use of oxytocin in labour is a common risk factor for rupture of a scarred uterus.
