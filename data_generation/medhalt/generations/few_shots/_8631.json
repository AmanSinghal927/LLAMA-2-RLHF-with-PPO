It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition. The SMN2 gene is also involved in the development of SMA, but it is not as critical as the SMN1 gene.\n\n", "output1": "The SMN1 gene is located on chromosome 5 and is responsible for the production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. The SMN1 gene is responsible for the production of the SMN protein, which is essential for the survival of these nerve cells. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition, whereas autosomal recessive inheritance requires two copies of the mutated gene.\n\n", "output2": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder that affects the nerve cells responsible for muscle movement. The SMN1 gene is responsible for producing the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is essential for the survival of these nerve cells. The SMN2 gene also produces the SMN protein, but in smaller amounts. SMA is caused by a deficiency of the SMN protein, which leads to the degeneration of nerve cells in the spinal cord and muscle weakness. The inheritance pattern of SMA is autosomal recessive, which means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disorder.\n\n", "output3": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. This gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition. However, some people with SMA may have a milder form of the condition due to a backup copy of the gene called SMN2. This backup copy is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a child only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene to develop the condition.\n\n"}, {"question": "According to Siebert (1983) class II ridge defects is?", "correct_answer": "Loss of apico-coronal height but normal bucco-lingual width", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Loss of bucco-lingual width but normal apico-coronal height", "B)Loss of apico-coronal height but normal bucco-lingual width", "C)Combination of loss of both height and width of the ridge", "D)None of above"], "prompt": "According to Siebert (1983) class II ridge defects is?A)Loss of bucco-lingual width but normal apico-coronal height\nB)Loss of apico-coronal height but normal bucco-lingual width\nC)Combination of loss of both height and width of the ridge\nD)None of above", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Class II ridge defects, as described by Siebert in 1983, refer to a loss of bucco-lingual width but with normal apico-coronal height.

This approach is often used to help children in this age group develop better self-control and emotional regulation skills.\n\n", "output2": "According to Siebert (1983), class II ridge defects are characterized by a combination of loss of both height and width of the ridge.

The Turtle Technique is not specifically indicated for these types of injuries, but rather for the management of bladder rupture in the context of pelvic fractures.\n\n", "output2": "Intraperitoneal bladder rupture is a surgical technique used to repair a ruptured bladder that has occurred within the peritoneal cavity. This approach involves making an incision in the abdominal wall and directly suturing the bladder rupture site. The probe is inserted through the extraperitoneal space, and the wound is closed without opening the peritoneal cavity. This approach is less invasive and has a faster recovery time compared to open surgery.\n\n", "output3": "The answer is D)Extraperitoneal bladder rupture (extraperitoneal bladder rupture) of photographic bladder (cystography) can be found between the distribution of the developer in the gut. This is because the bladder rupture can cause a fistula between the bladder and the gut, which can lead to the leakage of urine into the abdominal cavity. This can be detected by cystography, which is a diagnostic test that uses a contrast agent to visualize the bladder and the urinary tract. The test can show the presence of a fistula between the bladder and the gut, which can help the doctor determine the appropriate treatment for the patient.\n\n"}, {"question": "Structure not seen at L3 level ?", "correct_answer": "Coeliac trunk", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Iliac vessels", "B)Aoa", "C)Coeliac trunk", "D)IVC"], "prompt": "Structure not seen at L3 level ?A)Iliac vessels\nB)Aoa\nC)Coeliac trunk\nD)IVC", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "output0": "The Iliac vessels are not visible at the L3 level.
