The exact cause of the syndrome is not known, but it is thought to be related to a viral infection.\n\n", "output1": "Dressler syndrome is a rare condition that is believed to be caused by an autoimmune response. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, leading to inflammation and damage to the skin and other organs.\n\n", "output2": "Dressler syndrome is considered an idiopathic disorder, meaning that it has no known cause. It is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but the exact cause is not well understood.\n\n", "output3": "Dressler Syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when a person is exposed to a toxin, such as a chemical or a drug, and experiences a severe allergic reaction. The condition is characterized by a rash, fever, and joint pain. The aetiology of Dressler Syndrome is therefore toxin mediated.\n\n"}, {"question": "Best indicator of antemoem drowning is:Delhi 07; TN 11", "correct_answer": "Froth in nostrils", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Froth in nostrils", "B)Cutis anserina", "C)Washerwoman's hand", "D)Water in stomach"], "prompt": "Best indicator of antemoem drowning is:Delhi 07; TN 11A)Froth in nostrils\nB)Cutis anserina\nC)Washerwoman's hand\nD)Water in stomach", "subject_name": "Forensic Medicine", "output0": "The presence of froth in the nostrils is a clear indicator of antemortem drowning, as it indicates that the victim was still alive when they entered the water.

This is because gold is a hard metal that contributes to the hardness of the solder. With a lower gold content, the solder will be softer and more prone to deformation.\n\n", "output1": "If the gold content in solder is decreased, it will lead to an increase in ductility. This is because gold is a soft and ductile metal, and its presence in the solder helps to reduce the brittleness and improve the flexibility of the solder.\n\n", "output2": "If the gold content in solder is decreased, it will lead to a decrease in the corrosion resistance of the solder. This is because gold is a noble metal that has excellent corrosion resistance, and reducing its content will result in a loss of this property.\n\n", "output3": "If the gold content in solder is decreased, the tensile strength of the solder will also decrease. This is because gold is a strong and ductile metal that helps to reinforce the solder and improve its mechanical properties.
