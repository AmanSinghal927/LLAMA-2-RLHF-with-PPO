This bias occurs when people are more likely to recall information that occurred recently, and less likely to recall information that occurred further in the past.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Memory or recall bias. This is because the question refers to a recent past event, and the respondent may have difficulty recalling specific details about the event that occurred longer ago. This is an example of memory bias, as the respondent is more likely to remember information that is more recent and less likely to remember information that is further in the past.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Exposure/Suspicion bias. This type of bias occurs when people are more likely to remember or report recent events that are more vivid or emotionally charged, while older events may be less well-remembered or overlooked.
