[{"question": "What blood pressure lowering drugs following mechanism of action is via a pathway NO-cGMP?", "correct_answer": "Nitroprusside", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Verapamil", "B)Trimethaphan", "C)Diazoxide", "D)Nitroprusside"], "prompt": "What blood pressure lowering drugs following mechanism of action is via a pathway NO-cGMP?A)Verapamil\nB)Trimethaphan\nC)Diazoxide\nD)Nitroprusside", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, works by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the contraction force of the smooth muscle cells, which results in vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. The mechanism of action of verapamil is via a pathway that involves the inhibition of the NO-cGMP pathway.\n\n", "output1": "Trimethaphan is a drug that lowers blood pressure by increasing the activity of nitric oxide (NO) and increasing the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This mechanism of action is via a pathway that involves the inhibition of phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cGMP. By increasing cGMP, trimethaphan causes relaxation of smooth muscle and dilatation of blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure.\n\n", "output2": "Diazoxide is a vasodilator that works by increasing the activity of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. This, in turn, increases the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which causes the smooth muscle in blood vessels to relax and widen. This mechanism of action is known as the NO-cGMP pathway.\n\n", "output3": "Nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor, works by increasing nitric oxide production, which in turn increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. This increase in cGMP leads to relaxation of smooth muscle cells and vasodilation. Therefore, the correct answer is D)Nitroprusside.\n\n"}, {"question": "In a real dog study, a solution containing an excess of perfused aldosterone (aldosterone), the blood which is up to 20 times the concentration of aldosterone, the following phenomena are most likely to occur where?", "correct_answer": "Resulting in urinary sodium excretion rate increased role in sustainable than two weeks", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)In the short term (five days or less), will result in mean arterial hypertension", "B)Resulting in urinary sodium excretion rate increased role in sustainable than two weeks", "C)In the short term (five days or less), it will cause an increase in extracellular fluid volume of the cell", "D)In the long term (more than two weeks), mean arterial blood pressure will return to the value before perfusion"], "prompt": "In a real dog study, a solution containing an excess of perfused aldosterone (aldosterone), the blood which is up to 20 times the concentration of aldosterone, the following phenomena are most likely to occur where?A)In the short term (five days or less), will result in mean arterial hypertension\nB)Resulting in urinary sodium excretion rate increased role in sustainable than two weeks\nC)In the short term (five days or less), it will cause an increase in extracellular fluid volume of the cell\nD)In the long term (more than two weeks), mean arterial blood pressure will return to the value before perfusion", "subject_name": null, "output0": "When a solution containing an excess of perfused aldosterone is introduced into the bloodstream, it will cause an increase in the concentration of aldosterone in the blood. This increase in aldosterone will lead to an increase in the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys, which will result in an increase in mean arterial blood pressure. This effect is most pronounced in the short term, and will typically last for five days or less.\n\n", "output1": "When a solution containing an excess of perfused aldosterone is administered to dogs, the increased sodium concentration in the blood will cause an increase in urinary sodium excretion rate. This effect is sustained for more than two weeks, which is the characteristic feature of the Turtle Technique.\n\n", "output2": "When a solution containing an excess of perfused aldosterone is administered to a dog, it will cause an increase in extracellular fluid volume in the short term (five days or less). This is because aldosterone stimulates the kidneys to retain sodium and water, leading to an increase in blood volume and extracellular fluid volume. However, in the long term (more than two weeks), the body will adapt to the increased sodium and water levels, and the mean arterial blood pressure will return to its pre-perfusion value.\n\n", "output3": "When the body is exposed to high levels of aldosterone, it will cause an increase in extracellular fluid volume in the short term. However, in the long term, the body will adapt to the increased aldosterone levels by increasing the expression of aldosterone receptors and increasing the excretion of sodium and water. This will lead to a return to normal mean arterial blood pressure.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following does not belong to the disease neurocutaneous syndromes?", "correct_answer": "multiple sclerosis", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Sturge-Weber syndrome", "B)multiple sclerosis", "C)von Hippel Lindau disease", "D)incontinence pigmenti"], "prompt": "Which of the following does not belong to the disease neurocutaneous syndromes?A)Sturge-Weber syndrome\nB)multiple sclerosis\nC)von Hippel Lindau disease\nD)incontinence pigmenti", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Sturge-Weber syndrome is not a neurocutaneous syndrome, but rather a neurological disorder.
