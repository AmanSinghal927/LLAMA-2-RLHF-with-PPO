It promotes the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation, and inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone resorption. In normal bone healing, IL-4 is produced by T cells and other immune cells, and it helps to regulate the balance between bone formation and resorption.\n\n", "output1": "Interferon-\u03b1 is a cytokine that plays a critical role in the regulation of normal bone healing. It is produced by cells in the bone microenvironment and acts on osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and stem cells to promote bone healing. In the case of the patient with a nondisplaced proximal humerus fracture, interferon-\u03b1 is likely to be involved in the healing process.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. G-CSF is a cytokine that plays a critical role in normal bone healing. It stimulates the production and activation of granulocytes, which are important in the repair of damaged tissues.
