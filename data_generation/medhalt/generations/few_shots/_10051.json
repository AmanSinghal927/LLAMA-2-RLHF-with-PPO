Additionally, the X and Y chromosomes are both involved in determining the sex of the individual.\n\n", "output1": "Classic karyotypes are made with metaphase chromosomes because this stage of the cell cycle is characterized by the condensation of chromosomes and the formation of a clear and visible pattern. This allows for the identification of the chromosomes and their characteristics, which is the main purpose of a karyotype.\n\n", "output2": "During all mitosis, the chromosomes are free in the cytoplasm. This is the correct answer because in mitosis the chromosomes are not attached to the spindle fibers until the metaphase stage.\n\n", "output3": "The two X chromosomes originate in the woman the appearance of two corpuscles of Barr because the X chromosomes are present in the female gametes (egg cells) and are visible as two Barr bodies in the nucleus of the egg cell.\n\n"}, {"question": "A female with suspected child abuse was brought to the casualty with severe bleeding from the perineum.

Once the airway is secured, the healthcare provider can assess the extent of the bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.\n\n", "output1": "The first line of management for a female with suspected child abuse and severe bleeding from the perineum should be internal iliac artery ligation to control bleeding. This is because the risk of death from bleeding is high in this situation, and the child may have a ruptured internal organ or other severe injuries.\n\n", "output2": "The first line of management for a female with suspected child abuse and severe bleeding from the perineum should be whole blood transfusion.
