This is evident from the patient's symptoms of oxygen desaturation and the presence of a 2/6 systolic murmur. The murmur is indicative of a shunt, which is a condition where blood flows from one chamber of the heart to another, resulting in an abnormal circulation of blood. In this case, the VSD likely caused a shunt from the right ventricle to the left ventricle, leading to a decrease in oxygenation of the body.\n\n", "output2": "The most likely direct cause of the patient's death is myocardial free wall rupture. This is supported by the presence of a 2/6 systolic murmur, which indicates that the patient had a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack). The drop in blood pressure during surgery and the ST elevations in multiple leads are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's oxygen desaturation and the presence of crackles on auscultation suggest that the patient had pulmonary edema, which is a common complication of myocardial infarction.\n\n", "output3": "The most likely direct cause of the patient's death is myocardial reinfarction. The patient experienced a significant drop in blood pressure during surgery, which can lead to inadequate blood flow to the heart and cause myocardial ischemia.
