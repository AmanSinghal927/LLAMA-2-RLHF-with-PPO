This is because the brain is not as actively engaged in the exercise as the muscles are, and therefore does not require as much blood flow.\n\n", "output1": "During moderate exercise, the blood supply to the brain remains constant. This is because the brain is a relatively low-demand organ in terms of oxygen and nutrients, and it is not as heavily reliant on the cardiovascular system as other organs such as the muscles.\n\n", "output2": "During moderate exercise, the blood supply to the brain increases as the heart rate and blood pressure rise.
