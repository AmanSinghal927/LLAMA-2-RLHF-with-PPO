Additionally, the cultural context can influence the way mental health professionals approach diagnosis and treatment.\n\n", "output1": "Culture plays a significant role in shaping the way people experience and express mental health issues. Different cultures have unique beliefs, values, and practices that can influence the way mental health issues are perceived, expressed, and addressed.
