This is because the patient has a history of pancreatic cancer and is experiencing swelling of the right leg, which could be a sign of pulmonary embolism. The patient is also experiencing nausea and has a fever, which are additional symptoms of pulmonary embolism. CT pulmonary angiography is the best diagnostic test to rule out this condition.\n\n", "output1": "Compression ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's swelling of the right leg. This non-invasive test can help identify the presence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common complication after surgery like the Whipple procedure. The patient's symptoms of swelling and nausea, along with the risk of DVT after surgery, make this test a priority.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)D-dimer level. The patient's symptoms of swelling and nausea without pain or fever suggest a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The absence of Homan's sign and the presence of swelling in only one leg suggest that the PE is likely to be a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rather than a PE. The patient's history of pancreatic cancer and recent surgery increase the risk of DVT. The D-dimer level is a non-invasive test that can help confirm the diagnosis of DVT.\n\n", "output3": "The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be to perform 2 sets of blood cultures. This is indicated because the patient has a history of pancreatic cancer and is experiencing swelling of her right leg without any pain or fever, which could be a sign of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Additionally, the patient has a recent history of surgery, which increases the risk of DVT. Blood cultures would help to confirm or rule out the presence of a DVT and guide appropriate anticoagulation therapy.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 47-year-old man, with a history of a right parotid pleomorphic adenoma, treated with surgery (extrafacial parotidectomy) 6 months ago, who came to our clinic because he presented pain during the mastication with sweating and reddening of the skin of the preauricular region.
