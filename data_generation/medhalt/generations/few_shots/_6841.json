This is because the patient has severe sunburns and erythematous skin, which are indicative of DNA damage. The fact that the patient\u2019s corneas also appear irritated and erythematous suggests that the damage is not limited to the skin.\n\n", "output1": "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a process that is impaired in infants with severe sunburns. NHEJ is a mechanism that repairs DNA double-strand breaks that are not repairable by homologous recombination. In infants, the NHEJ pathway is not well developed, making them more susceptible to DNA damage from sun exposure.\n\n", "output2": "Homologous recombination is the process by which cells repair DNA double-strand breaks. This process is impaired in infants, as they have not yet developed the ability to perform homologous recombination. As a result, they are more susceptible to sunburns and other forms of DNA damage.\n\n", "output3": "Mismatch repair is the process that is likely impaired in this patient. Mismatch repair is a mechanism that corrects errors in DNA replication and recombination, and is essential for maintaining genome stability. Impairment of mismatch repair can lead to the accumulation of mutations and the development of cancer. In this case, the severe sunburns and reddened skin suggest that the patient may have a defect in mismatch repair, which could contribute to the development of skin cancer.\n\n"}, {"question": "What is not seen in sho bowel syndrome", "correct_answer": "Hirsutism", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Hypergastrinemia & high gastric secretion is seen", "B)Diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition", "C)Hirsutism", "D)Chronic TPN dependence"], "prompt": "What is not seen in sho bowel syndromeA)Hypergastrinemia & high gastric secretion is seen\nB)Diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition\nC)Hirsutism\nD)Chronic TPN dependence", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "Hypergastrinemia and high gastric secretion are not typically seen in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
