This is because the lesion is likely a benign growth, such as a papilloma or a condyloma, and an incisional biopsy will allow for the removal of the lesion while preserving as much tissue as possible.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)Perform excisional biopsy because the lesion has a rough, \"warty\" surface, which is indicative of a potentially malignant condition. An excisional biopsy is necessary to remove the lesion and obtain a definitive diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The appropriate management of a pedunculated lesion on the soft palate with a rough, \"warty\" surface is to perform exfoliative cytology.
