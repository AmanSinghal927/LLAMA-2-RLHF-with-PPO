This phenomenon occurs when the mucus in the nasal passages helps to remove the drug from the nasal cavity, which can reduce the amount of drug that is absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\n", "output1": "The nasal mucosa is a relatively poorly vascularized area, which can limit the absorption of drugs administered via this route. This is especially true for drugs that are highly lipophilic and have low water solubility, as they tend to be poorly absorbed through the nasal mucosa.\n\n", "output2": "When the absorption of a drug is by passive diffusion, the rate of absorption is inversely proportional to the concentration of the drug at the absorption site. This means that if the concentration of the drug is high, the rate of absorption will be slower, and if the concentration is low, the rate of absorption will be faster.\n\n", "output3": "The molecular weight and distribution coefficient of a drug do not affect its nasal absorption because the nasal mucosa is not a selective barrier. The drug molecules are absorbed by passive diffusion through the mucosa and then enter the bloodstream.
