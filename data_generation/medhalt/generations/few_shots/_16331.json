This is because REM sleep is characterized by the presence of these two physiological markers. Sleep spindles are bursts of high-frequency activity in the brain that occur during REM sleep, and K complexes are sudden increases in brain activity that occur just before the onset of REM sleep.\n\n", "output1": "Body temperature decreases slightly during sleep because the body's thermoregulatory system is suppressed during REM sleep. This is why it is often more difficult to wake up someone who is sleeping during REM sleep.\n\n", "output2": "The first REM sleep period is usually longer than the rest because the body needs to recover from the day's activities and consolidate memories. This is why the first REM sleep period is often longer and more intense than the rest.\n\n", "output3": "Phase I of non-REM sleep is the period of lightest sleep, during which the body is most easily awakened. It is also the stage of sleep during which the body is most active, with increased heart rate and brain waves.
