This approach is used to treat conditions such as gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Unlike other types of vagotomy, highly selective vagotomy is designed to preserve the entire gastric reservoir capacity, which is the ability of the stomach to store food and digestive enzymes. This is because the reservoir capacity is important for the proper digestion of food and the prevention of complications such as vomiting.\n\n"}, {"question": "APGAR acronym stands for?", "correct_answer": "Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Activity, pulse pressure, grimace, appearance, rate of respiration", "B)Appearance, pressure, grimace, MAP, hea rate", "C)Appearance, pressure, grimace, appearance, rate of hea beat", "D)Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration"], "prompt": "APGAR acronym stands for?A)Activity, pulse pressure, grimace, appearance, rate of respiration\nB)Appearance, pressure, grimace, MAP, hea rate\nC)Appearance, pressure, grimace, appearance, rate of hea beat\nD)Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration", "subject_name": "Pediatrics", "output0": "The APGAR acronym stands for Activity, Pulse, Grimace, Appearance, and Respiration.

The bulbocavernosus reflex is a reflex that is tested by stroking the bulbocavernosus muscle, which is located in the lower back.
