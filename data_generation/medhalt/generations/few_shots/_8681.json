This is often seen in individuals with strabismus (crossed eyes) or other eye alignment disorders.\n\n", "output1": "Ansiokonia is a condition in which a person experiences a projection of different shaped images into the visual cortex of two retinae. This can cause the person to perceive objects as being larger or smaller than they actually are.\n\n", "output2": "Ansiokonia is a term used to describe the phenomenon of the apparent change in the velocity of perceived objects when the observer's visual field is rapidly shifted. This can occur when the observer's head or body is suddenly moved, causing the visual field to shift rapidly.\n\n", "output3": "Ansiokonia is a visual phenomenon that refers to the temporary loss of vision in one eye when the other eye is covered. This occurs due to the fact that the brain has difficulty processing visual information from one eye when the other eye is covered.
