The presence of pleural effusion, predominance of neutrophils, and absence of mesothelial cells are all indicative of a non-infectious etiology, and the negative results of Ziehl staining and mycobacterial culture support this. Additionally, the elevated adenosine deaminase in pleural fluid suggests that there is an inflammatory process present. PET would allow for the evaluation of the extent of the disease and the response to treatment, which would be useful information for the patient's oncologist.\n\n", "output2": "The most cost-effective diagnostic test for a patient with pleuritic pain and suspected tuberculosis would be a culture of mycobacteria in the blood.

Additionally, it can be performed in a local laboratory and does not require specialized equipment or expertise.\n\n", "output3": "The determination of lysozyme in pleural fluid is the most cost-effective diagnostic test for this patient. Lysozyme is an enzyme that is produced by cells of the immune system and is present in the pleural fluid in cases of tuberculosis. In this case, the absence of mesothelial cells in the pleural fluid and the presence of neutrophils and a serohemorrhagic exudate suggest that the patient may have tuberculosis. The Ziehl staining and mycobacterial culture were negative, so the determination of lysozyme in pleural fluid would be the most cost-effective diagnostic test to rule out tuberculosis.\n\n"}, {"question": "A child presented to an ohopaedic clinic with a limp.

The stratum corneum is composed of dead, flattened cells that are held together by lipid bilayers.

This leads to the formation of pruritic wheals on the skin.\n\n", "output1": "The histologic changes that occur in the skin during type I hypersensitivity-mediated histamine release are primarily seen in the stratum granulosum layer of the skin. This layer is composed of keratinocytes that are in the process of undergoing differentiation and maturation.
