Since the twins are genetically identical, the transplanted tissue will not be rejected by the recipient's immune system.\n\n", "output1": "An allograft is a transplant of tissue from one identical twin to the other. Since the twins are identical, the tissue is genetically identical, which reduces the risk of rejection.\n\n", "output2": "Autograft is the transplantation of tissue from one part of the body to another. In the case of identical twins, the tissue is from one twin to the other, so it is considered an autograft.\n\n", "output3": "Xenograft is the transplantation of an organ or tissue from one species to another, such as from a pig to a human. This type of transplantation is not possible with identical twins, as they are the same species and therefore cannot be considered xenografts.\n\n"}, {"question": "G2P1L1 female with 1 : 4 anti D titres at 28 weeks gestation, management is", "correct_answer": "MCA Doppler", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)MCA Doppler", "B)Caesarean section", "C)Induction of labour", "D)Amniocentesis"], "prompt": "G2P1L1 female with 1 : 4 anti D titres at 28 weeks gestation, management isA)MCA Doppler\nB)Caesarean section\nC)Induction of labour\nD)Amniocentesis", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The correct answer is A)MCA Doppler because the patient has a history of previous Caesarean section and the presence of anti-D antibodies in her blood, which indicates that she is at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn. MCA Doppler is a non-invasive test that can detect any abnormal blood flow in the umbilical cord and can help identify any potential risks to the baby.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is Caesarean section because the presence of anti-D titres at 28 weeks gestation indicates that the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive, which increases the risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn. In this case, a Caesarean section would be performed to avoid the risk of sensitization of the mother and the potential for complications in the newborn.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Induction of labour. The presence of 1:4 anti-D titres at 28 weeks gestation indicates that the mother has developed an immune response to the Rh-positive fetus, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn. Induction of labour is the recommended management approach in this situation to minimize the risk of complications for both the mother and the baby.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Amniocentesis because the patient has a history of previous anti-D negative pregnancies and the current pregnancy is at 28 weeks gestation, which is considered high risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.
