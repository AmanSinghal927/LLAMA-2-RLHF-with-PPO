This is often seen in patients with cancer who are taking certain medications or undergoing certain treatments. The normal CT scan of the brain suggests that the patient's confusion is not due to a stroke or other structural brain abnormality. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hyponatremia due to excessive sodium loss.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's symptoms of confusion, dry mouth, constipation, and polyuria are consistent with hypercalcemia, which is an excess of calcium in the blood. The patient's history of breast cancer and the presence of bone metastases also support this diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of dry mouth, constipation, and polyuria are all indicative of hyperkalemia, which is a condition where there is too much potassium in the blood.

Atropine is a cholinergic agent that can increase the heart rate and improve cardiac output. In the case of a third-degree atrioventricular block, the ventricular escape rate is very slow, which can lead to inadequate cardiac output and poor perfusion of the organs. Atropine can help increase the heart rate and improve the cardiac output, which can be lifesaving in this situation.\n\n", "output3": "Digoxin is the most indicated drug to use in this situation until the placement of a pacemaker. This is because digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that can slow the heart rate and increase the conduction velocity in the AV node, which can help to control the bradycardia and the third-degree atrioventricular block.\n\n"}, {"question": "Tonic neck reflex disappears at what age ?", "correct_answer": "6 months", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)1 month", "B)2 months", "C)3 months", "D)6 months"], "prompt": "Tonic neck reflex disappears at what age ?A)1 month\nB)2 months\nC)3 months\nD)6 months", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "The Tonic Neck Reflex disappears around 1 month of age.
