This occurs because local anesthetics bind to the nerve membrane and alter the membrane potential, making it more difficult for the nerve to fire.\n\n", "output1": "The rapid onset of action seen with local anesthesia in small nerve endings is due to the low pH of the nerve fibers. This low pH causes the nerve fibers to become depolarized and lose their ability to conduct signals.\n\n", "output2": "The high ratio of surface area to volume of small nerve fibres allows for rapid onset of action seen by local anesthesia in small nerve endings.
