Pulsatile GnRH therapy was initiated to stimulate the production of gonadotropins, which would normally stimulate the growth of the follicle and ovulation. The loss of gap junctions between the cumulus granulosa cells and the oocyte is a characteristic of the luteinization phase of the menstrual cycle, which is the stage at which the follicle is ready to release the ovum.
