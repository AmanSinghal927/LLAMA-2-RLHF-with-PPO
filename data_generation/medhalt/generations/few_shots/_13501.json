This results in a smaller size range of particles, as compared to other methods such as compression or impact, which may not be as effective in producing smaller particle sizes.\n\n", "output1": "Compression methods, such as rolling or pressing, are effective in reducing the particle size of a powder mixture. This is because the force applied to the mixture causes the particles to deform and break apart, resulting in smaller particle sizes.\n\n", "output2": "Impact methods, such as hammer mills and pin mills, are designed to break the particles into smaller sizes by applying high levels of force. This results in a narrower size range of the particles, as compared to cutting or compression methods.\n\n", "output3": "Methods of friction, such as rubbing or grinding, can reduce the size of particles in a powder mixture to smaller size ranges. This is because the friction causes the particles to break down and become smaller.\n\n"}, {"question": "The pattern of change of disease of mortality and morbidity where the pandemics of infection are replaced by degenerative and manmade disorders as the main cause of morbidity and mortality is known as?", "correct_answer": "Epidemiological transition", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Epidemiological transition", "B)Demographic transition", "C)Paradoxical transition", "D)Reversal of transition"], "prompt": "The pattern of change of disease of mortality and morbidity where the pandemics of infection are replaced by degenerative and manmade disorders as the main cause of morbidity and mortality is known as?A)Epidemiological transition\nB)Demographic transition\nC)Paradoxical transition\nD)Reversal of transition", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "The epidemiological transition refers to the shift in the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases to degenerative and manmade disorders.
