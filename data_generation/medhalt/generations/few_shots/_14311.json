Aortic dissection is a tear in the inner lining of the aorta that can lead to sudden and catastrophic bleeding, which can cause cardiac arrest and death.\n\n", "output1": "Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of sudden death in patients with acute myocardial infarction. It is an arrhythmia that can lead to cardiac arrest and death if not promptly treated.\n\n", "output2": "Cardiac tamponade is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in patients with acute myocardial infarction. It is caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac that surrounds the heart, which can compress the heart and impair its ability to function properly. This can lead to sudden death if not treated promptly.\n\n", "output3": "Ventricular fibrillation is a condition in which the ventricles of the heart are unable to pump blood effectively, leading to a rapid deterioration of the patient's condition and potentially causing sudden death. In the case of a patient with an acute myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation can be a life-threatening complication.\n\n"}, {"question": "What is the proportion of patients with anorexia nervosa who develop bulimia nervosa ?:", "correct_answer": "Around 50% of patients.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Around 50% of patients.", "B)The totality of those patients.", "C)Only 5% of patients.", "D)Around 80% of patients."], "prompt": "What is the proportion of patients with anorexia nervosa who develop bulimia nervosa ?:A)Around 50% of patients.\nB)The totality of those patients.\nC)Only 5% of patients.\nD)Around 80% of patients.", "subject_name": "psychology", "output0": "According to research, around 50% of patients with anorexia nervosa will develop bulimia nervosa at some point in their lives.

By using this probe, healthcare professionals can detect aspiration and prevent complications.\n\n", "output2": "Placing the patient in a Semi-Fowler position can help prevent aspiration in patients with Enteral Nutrition. This position helps to reduce the risk of gastric contents entering the trachea.\n\n", "output3": "The Trendelemburg position is a position in which the patient's head is elevated and the body is tilted backwards. This position helps to prevent aspiration by allowing gravity to keep the stomOt contents in the stomach and not let them flow into the lungs.\n\n"}, {"question": "87-year-old man with a history of hypertension and gonarthrosis.
