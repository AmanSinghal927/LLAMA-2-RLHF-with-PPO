This increase in free fatty acids can then be used by the muscles for energy.\n\n", "output1": "The epinephrine increases lipolysis, which is the breakdown of stored fat (triglycerides) into free fatty acids and glycerol. This process is mediated by hormone-sensitive lipase, an enzyme that is activated by epinephrine. As a result, the level of free fatty acids in the bloodstream increases.\n\n", "output2": "Epinephrine increases free fatty acid level by increasing cholesterol catabolism. When epinephrine is released, it causes the breakdown of stored fat (triglycerides) into free fatty acids, which can then be used for energy.\n\n", "output3": "Epinephrine increases free fatty acid levels by causing all of the above. It increases lipolysis, which releases fatty acids from adipose tissue into the bloodstream, and it also increases cholesterol catabolism, which breaks down cholesterol into smaller components that can be used as energy. Additionally, epinephrine can stimulate the synthesis of new fatty acids from glucose and other substrates.\n\n"}, {"question": "Ideal desk recommended for a school child is \u2013", "correct_answer": "Minus desk", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Plus desk", "B)Minus desk", "C)Zero desk", "D)None of the above"], "prompt": "Ideal desk recommended for a school child is \u2013A)Plus desk\nB)Minus desk\nC)Zero desk\nD)None of the above", "subject_name": "Social & Preventive Medicine", "output0": "A Plus desk is ideal for school children because it allows them to work in a more comfortable position, which helps to improve their focus and productivity.
