Additionally, the patient's current medications, including inhaled salmeterol and fluticasone propionate, are appropriate for asthma management. However, the patient's symptoms of depression may be exacerbated by the use of amitriptyline, which is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause sedation and dry mouth.
