This is because the chi-square test is a non-parametric test, which means it does not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data. Additionally, the chi-square test is a powerful test that can detect small differences between the two groups, which is important when working with small sample sizes.\n\n", "output1": "The student t-test is the best test to compare the means of two groups of people, as it is a statistical test that can determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups. It is particularly useful when comparing the means of two groups of people that are of different sizes, such as in this case.\n\n", "output2": "The McNemar chi-square test is used to compare the proportions of two groups with related or paired data.
