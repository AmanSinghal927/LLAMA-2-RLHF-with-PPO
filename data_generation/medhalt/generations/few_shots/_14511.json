This is because hydrophobic interactions are important for the binding of proteins to lipids in the membrane.\n\n", "output1": "Protein domains that have predominance of dicarboxylic amino acids, such as glutamic and aspartic acids, are known to interact strongly with membrane lipids, promoting firm binding of integral membrane proteins. This is because the negative charge of the carboxylate group of these amino acids is attracted to the positively charged headgroups of lipids, forming a strong electrostatic interaction.\n\n", "output2": "Basic amino acids, such as lysine and arginine, have a positive charge and are therefore attracted to the negatively charged phospholipid headgroups of membrane lipids. This interaction helps to anchor the protein to the membrane and promote firm binding.\n\n", "output3": "Protein domains with predominance of hydroxyamino acids (such as serine and threonine) can interact with membrane lipids to promote firm binding of integral membrane proteins. These hydroxyamino acids can form hydrogen bonds with the hydrophilic head groups of lipids, enhancing the stability of the protein-lipid interactions.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with fever, malaise, and intense pain in the anterior neck.
