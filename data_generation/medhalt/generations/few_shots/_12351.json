It is characterized by a swelling of the scalp and face, and is often seen in cases where the baby is born in distress or with a low Apgar score. As the fetus is alive at the time of birth, the condition is present immediately after birth, hence option A is the correct answer.\n\n", "output1": "Caput succedaneum is a condition that occurs when the baby's head is compressed during delivery, causing the skin to swell and turn blue. This condition is often seen in babies who were alive at the time of delivery but were not breathing properly. The swelling typically resolves within 2-3 days after birth.\n\n", "output2": "The term caput succedaneum refers to the swelling of the scalp that occurs when the fetus is alive and undergoes a traumatic birth. This swelling is a sign that the fetus was alive at least 2-3 weeks before birth.\n\n", "output3": "Caput succedaneum is a condition that occurs when the fetus is alive at the time of birth, but dies shortly after. It is characterized by a swelling of the head and face. The condition is typically seen in cases where the fetus is in distress and dies within a few minutes or hours after birth.
