This means that if one parent has the mutation, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.\n\n", "output1": "Class I type I has strong familial inheritance, meaning that it is more likely to be inherited from parents to children. This is because Class I type I is the most common type of hypersensitivity and is often associated with allergies that are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n", "output2": "Class II div I has strong familial inheritance because it is associated with a higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. This is due to the presence of certain genetic markers that increase the risk of developing these conditions.\n\n", "output3": "Class II div II has strong familial inheritance because it is associated with a higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and type 1 diabetes. This is because the genetic variants that contribute to the development of Class II div II are often inherited in a familial manner.\n\n"}, {"question": "The function of Paneth cells is to secrete which of the following?", "correct_answer": "antibacterial likelysozyme", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)mucus", "B)antibacterial likelysozyme", "C)alkalinefluid", "D)acidicfluid"], "prompt": "The function of Paneth cells is to secrete which of the following?A)mucus\nB)antibacterial likelysozyme\nC)alkalinefluid\nD)acidicfluid", "subject_name": "Unknown", "output0": "Paneth cells secrete mucus, which helps to protect the gut and maintain the integrity of the epithelial lining.\n\n", "output1": "Paneth cells are specialized cells found in the small intestine that secrete antibacterial substances, including likelysozyme, to protect the gut from harmful bacteria and maintain a healthy gut microbiome.\n\n", "output2": "Paneth cells secrete an alkaline fluid that helps to maintain the acid-base balance in the small intestine and also has antimicrobial properties.\n\n", "output3": "Paneth cells are found in the small intestine and secrete an acidic fluid that helps to break down and digest food.
