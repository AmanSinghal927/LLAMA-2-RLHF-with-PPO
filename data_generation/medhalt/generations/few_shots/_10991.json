High-dose niacin can increase the risk of pancreatitis by increasing the amount of bile in the bloodstream. Bile deposition in the dermis can cause inflammation and scarring, leading to pancreatitis.\n\n", "output1": "The side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by the release of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are inflammatory mediators that can cause flushing, itching, and other adverse effects associated with niacin therapy.
