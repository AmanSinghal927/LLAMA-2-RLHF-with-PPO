It is non-invasive, easy to perform, and can provide accurate information about the size and location of the metastases.\n\n", "output1": "The best imaging modality for liver metastasis in gastric carcinoma is CECT (Computed Tomography Enteroclysis). This is because CECT provides a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of liver metastases, as well as a detailed visualization of the biliary system and the liver parenchyma.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)MRI because it is the best imaging modality for liver metastasis in gastric carcinoma. MRI can provide high-resolution images of the liver and surrounding structures, allowing for accurate detection and characterization of liver metastases. Additionally, MRI can help to detect small liver metastases that may be missed by other imaging modalities.\n\n", "output3": "HIDA Scan is a preferred imaging modality for liver metastasis in gastric carcinoma because it can detect liver metastases with high sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, HIDA Scan is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive imaging technique compared to other imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.\n\n"}, {"question": "Spinal cord injury patients about checking the narrative, which of the following error?", "correct_answer": "Only patients with paralysis of the lower limbs, upper limbs properly, can completely eliminate cervical spine injury", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)If the patient, complete paralysis of the lower limbs, but normal nervous system, usually means cervical spine injuries", "B)Only patients with paralysis of the lower limbs, upper limbs properly, can completely eliminate cervical spine injury", "C)Patients within 48 to 72 hours after traumatic limb can retain the motor or sensory, it usually indicates better prognosis", "D)Any patient with spinal cord injuries, the primary consideration is not any movement of the neck"], "prompt": "Spinal cord injury patients about checking the narrative, which of the following error?A)If the patient, complete paralysis of the lower limbs, but normal nervous system, usually means cervical spine injuries\nB)Only patients with paralysis of the lower limbs, upper limbs properly, can completely eliminate cervical spine injury\nC)Patients within 48 to 72 hours after traumatic limb can retain the motor or sensory, it usually indicates better prognosis\nD)Any patient with spinal cord injuries, the primary consideration is not any movement of the neck", "subject_name": null, "output0": "The correct answer is A)If the patient, complete paralysis of the lower limbs, but normal nervous system, usually means cervical spine injuries. This is because the cervical spine is responsible for controlling the movements of the lower limbs. If the patient has complete paralysis of the lower limbs, but the nervous system is normal, it is likely that the injury is in the cervical spine.\n\n", "output1": "Patients with complete paralysis of the lower limbs, but normal nervous system, usually have cervical spine injuries. This is because the spinal cord is located in the neck, and injuries to the neck can cause paralysis of the lower limbs. Therefore, patients with this symptom profile are more likely to have cervical spine injuries.\n\n", "output2": "Patients who retain motor or sensory function within 48 to 72 hours after a traumatic limb injury have a better prognosis for recovery. This is because the spinal cord has a limited capacity for self-repair, and any delay in treatment may result in permanent damage.\n\n", "output3": "Any patient with spinal cord injuries, the primary consideration is not any movement of the neck, because the neck is the most vulnerable part of the spine and can be easily damaged.\n\n"}, {"question": "Cardiac output increases maximum at which week?", "correct_answer": "32-34 wks", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)26-28wks", "B)30-32 wks", "C)32-34 wks", "D)34-36 wks"], "prompt": "Cardiac output increases maximum at which week?A)26-28wks\nB)30-32 wks\nC)32-34 wks\nD)34-36 wks", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "Cardiac output increases most rapidly during the 26-28 week gestation period. This is because the heart is undergoing significant growth and development during this time.\n\n", "output1": "Cardiac output reaches its maximum at around 30-32 weeks of gestation. This is because the baby's heart is fully developed at this point and is able to pump blood efficiently throughout the body.\n\n", "output2": "Cardiac output reaches its maximum at around 32-34 weeks of gestation. This is because the fetal heart is able to pump blood at a higher rate at this stage, due to the increased oxygenation of the body and the development of the cardiovascular system.\n\n", "output3": "Cardiac output reaches its maximum at around 34-36 weeks of gestation.

The presence of this enzyme is more common in cells that are involved in the citric acid cycle, such as liver and muscle cells.\n\n", "output1": "Pyruvate kinase is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis, which is the metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to produce energy. In cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase, the glycolytic pathway is likely to be inhibited or blocked, leading to a decrease in the activity of pyruvate kinase. Therefore, pyruvate kinase is most likely to be absent in these cells.\n\n", "output2": "The absence of bisphosphoglycerate mutase in these cells would lead to a decrease in the intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate. This would, in turn, affect the function of other enzymes that rely on bisphosphoglycerate as a cofactor. One such enzyme is glutathione reductase.\n\n", "output3": "The absence of bisphosphoglycerate mutase in these cells would indicate that the cells are unable to produce ATP through the glycolytic pathway. As a result, the activity of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway, such as pyruvate kinase, would be decreased. However, the absence of carbonic anhydrase would not be expected in these cells, as this enzyme is involved in the TCA cycle and is not directly related to glycolysis.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following has obvious anti-platelet aggregation effect?", "correct_answer": "abciximab", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)serotonin", "B)abciximab", "C)urokinase", "D)epinephrine"], "prompt": "Which of the following has obvious anti-platelet aggregation effect?A)serotonin\nB)abciximab\nC)urokinase\nD)epinephrine", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Serotonin has an obvious anti-platelet aggregation effect. It is a neurotransmitter that is produced by the body and plays a role in regulating various physiological processes, including platelet aggregation. When platelets are activated, they release serotonin, which in turn inhibits platelet aggregation and helps to prevent the formation of blood clots.\n\n", "output1": "Abciximab is a drug that has a well-known anti-platelet aggregation effect. It works by blocking the binding of platelets to damaged blood vessels, thereby reducing the risk of blood clots and stroke.\n\n", "output2": "Urokinase is a natural protein that has been shown to have an obvious anti-platelet aggregation effect.

Vitamin D is a hormone that regulates calcium levels in the body, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the active form of vitamin D. When vitamin D levels are high, it can cause an increase in calcium levels in the blood. This patient's history of hyperparathyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as her current use of hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic that can increase calcium levels, all suggest that she may have elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's hypercalcemia is most likely due to PTH-related protein production. PTH (parathyroid hormone) is a hormone produced by the parathyroid glands that helps regulate calcium levels in the body. When the body senses low calcium levels, PTH is released to stimulate the release of calcium from the bones and promote its absorption in the gut. In this patient's case, the hypercalcemia is likely due to an overproduction of PTH, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including primary hyperparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, and certain cancers.\n\n", "output2": "Thiazide diuretics, which are commonly used to treat hypertension, can cause hypercalcemia by increasing calcium reabsorption in the renal tubules. This is particularly true in patients with chronic kidney disease, as seen in this patient's history of hypertension and arthritis.
