This is because the patient\u2019s symptoms of pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, limited supination, and refusal to use the affected limb suggest a possible fracture or dislocation. Immobilization will help to prevent further injury and allow for proper healing.\n\n", "output1": "Moderate flexion and hyperpronation of the affected elbow is the next step in management for this patient. The patient's symptoms of pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, limited supination, and refusal to use the affected limb are consistent with a possible elbow fracture. Immobilization (A) or supination then maximal extension (D) are not appropriate at this time as they may exacerbate the injury. Radiograph (C) is also not the next step in management as it is not a definitive treatment for elbow fractures.\n\n", "output2": "The next step in management for this 3-year-old girl with an acute arm injury would be to obtain a radiograph. This is because the patient\u2019s symptoms of pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, limited supination, and a click or pop sound heard by the father, suggest a possible fracture. A radiograph would help to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.\n\n", "output3": "The next step in management for the patient's acute arm injury would be to perform supination and maximal extension of the affected arm. This is because the patient's symptoms of pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, and limited supination, suggest that she has likely sustained a supracondylar humeral fracture. Supination and maximal extension will help to confirm the diagnosis and provide a more accurate assessment of the extent of the injury.\n\n"}, {"question": "To which biopharmaceutical classification group does metoprolol belong if the dose (100 mg) is dissolved in an aqueous volume of 0.1 ml and has an oral fraction absorbed close to 90% ?:", "correct_answer": "Class I.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Class IV.", "B)Class III", "C)Class II", "D)Class I."], "prompt": "To which biopharmaceutical classification group does metoprolol belong if the dose (100 mg) is dissolved in an aqueous volume of 0.1 ml and has an oral fraction absorbed close to 90% ?:A)Class IV.\nB)Class III\nC)Class II\nD)Class I.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "Metoprolol, as a beta-blocker, belongs to the class IV biopharmaceutical classification. This classification is given to drugs that have a high degree of bioavailability and are well absorbed orally. The fact that the dose (100 mg) is dissolved in an aqueous volume of 0.1 ml and has an oral fraction absorbed close to 90% indicates that metoprolol is highly bioavailable and well absorbed, which supports its classification as a Class IV drug.\n\n", "output1": "Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, which is a Class III biopharmaceutical classification group.

Capsules are a solid dosage form that disintegrates in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing the drug to be absorbed more quickly than other forms, such as immediate-release tablets, which are more likely to be absorbed slowly over time. Therefore, the MAT and MIT are more likely to be the same for capsules than for other forms.\n\n", "output3": "The mean time of absorption (MAT) and the average residence time at the site of absorption (MIT) are related to the release of the drug from the dosage form. In forms of modified release, the drug is released over a longer period of time, which means that MAT and MIT are not coincident. In contrast, immediate-release formulations (option B) release the drug immediately, so MAT and MIT are the same.\n\n"}, {"question": "Histopathologic study of lichen planus shows:", "correct_answer": "Presence of T-Lymphocytes predominantly", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Mixed cellular inflammatory infiltrate", "B)Presence of T-Lymphocytes predominantly", "C)Antiepithelial antibodies", "D)Scattered infiltrate with ill-defined lower border"], "prompt": "Histopathologic study of lichen planus shows:A)Mixed cellular inflammatory infiltrate\nB)Presence of T-Lymphocytes predominantly\nC)Antiepithelial antibodies\nD)Scattered infiltrate with ill-defined lower border", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by a mixed cellular infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils.
