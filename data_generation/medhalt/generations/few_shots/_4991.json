The grey rami are present medial to the white rami, meaning they are located closer to the midline of the brain than the white rami.\n\n", "output2": "Grey rami communicantes are the fibres that carry pre-ganglionic sympathetic fibres from the spinal cord to the grey matter of the spinal cord. These fibres are not myelinated, which is why the correct answer is C)Carries pre-ganglionic fibres.\n\n", "output3": "Grey rami communicate fibres are non-myelinated because they are not covered with myelin sheaths, which are the insulating layers that surround the axons of nerve fibres. This means that the signals traveling along these fibres do not have the same speed and efficiency as signals traveling along myelinated fibres.\n\n"}, {"question": "In relation to the genetic polymorphism:", "correct_answer": "They are variations in the genome sequence that differentiate one individual from another.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)It does not occur due to point mutations.", "B)They are variations in the genome sequence that differentiate one individual from another.", "C)It only occurs in non-coding regions of the genome.", "D)The insertions are the only mechanisms to produce genetic polymorphism."], "prompt": "In relation to the genetic polymorphism:A)It does not occur due to point mutations.\nB)They are variations in the genome sequence that differentiate one individual from another.\nC)It only occurs in non-coding regions of the genome.\nD)The insertions are the only mechanisms to produce genetic polymorphism.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "The Turtle Technique is a behavioral intervention, and therefore it does not involve genetic polymorphism.
