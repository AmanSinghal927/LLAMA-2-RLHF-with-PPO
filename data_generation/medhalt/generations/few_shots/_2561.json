The larger the diameter of the axon, the greater the resting potential.\n\n", "output1": "The duration of the refractory potential is most dependent on the diameter of the axon. The refractory potential is the period of time after an action potential when the neuron is unable to fire again. This period is longer for larger axons because the action potential takes longer to propagate through the longer axon.\n\n", "output2": "The conduction velocity of an axon is most dependent on its diameter because the larger the diameter, the more myelinated the axon is, and the faster the action potential will travel.\n\n", "output3": "The overshoot of an action potential is most dependent on the diameter of the axon. The overshoot is the amount by which the action potential exceeds the resting potential, and it is directly related to the diameter of the axon. The larger the diameter of the axon, the greater the overshoot will be.\n\n"}, {"question": "True about enameloma", "correct_answer": "A globule like structure usually found on root due to misplaced ameloblast", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)A globule like structure usually found on root due to misplaced ameloblast", "B)True neoplasm of ameloblast", "C)Tumor resembling enamel present on gingiva", "D)Tumor of ameloblast which fail to differentiate terminally"], "prompt": "True about enamelomaA)A globule like structure usually found on root due to misplaced ameloblast\nB)True neoplasm of ameloblast\nC)Tumor resembling enamel present on gingiva\nD)Tumor of ameloblast which fail to differentiate terminally", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "Enameloma is a benign tumor that arises from the ameloblast, which is the cell responsible for producing enamel.
