In the case of the remote control, the fear response is not naturally present, so it is more difficult to acquire a conditioned response of fear. On the other hand, the insect is a natural stimulus that can elicit a fear response, making it easier to acquire a conditioned response of fear.\n\n", "output1": "According to the theory of biological preparation of Seligman, the brain has a set of neural circuits that are specialized for detecting and responding to threats. This preparation is more effective when the threat is perceived as being close and immediate, such as a small insect. In contrast, a remote control is perceived as being further away and less immediate, making it more difficult to elicit a conditioned fear response.\n\n", "output2": "According to Eysenck's theory of incubation, a stimulus is more likely to elicit a conditioned response if it is presented repeatedly during a period of time when the organism is in a state of arousal or heightened sensitivity. This is because the repeated exposure to the stimulus during this period of heightened sensitivity can lead to the formation of a conditioned response. In the case of a small insect, it may be more likely to elicit a conditioned response of fear because it is a more salient and threatening stimulus, whereas a remote control may be less threatening and therefore less likely to elicit a conditioned response.\n\n", "output3": "According to theories of anxiety expectations, such as the Reiss model, children are more likely to acquire a conditioned response of fear to a small insect than to a remote control because they have a greater expectation of danger from the insect. This expectation is based on their prior experiences and the perceived threat of the insect. In contrast, the remote control is perceived as less dangerous, and thus, there is less expectation of danger, making it more difficult to acquire a conditioned response of fear.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which enzymes have the function of changing the degree of DNA undercoiling ?:", "correct_answer": "The topoisomerases.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)the DNA ligases.", "B)The DNA helicases.", "C)The topoisomerases.", "D)The DNA polymerases."], "prompt": "Which enzymes have the function of changing the degree of DNA undercoiling ?:A)the DNA ligases.\nB)The DNA helicases.\nC)The topoisomerases.\nD)The DNA polymerases.", "subject_name": "chemistry", "output0": "DNA ligases are responsible for joining together the Okazaki fragments that form during DNA replication.

At the same time, the afterload, or the resistance to blood flow, is increased, which also increases the stroke volume.\n\n", "output2": "When preload and afterload are within normal physiological ranges, stroke volume is increased. This is because preload, the amount of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole, helps to increase stroke volume by providing a reserve of blood that can be ejected into the aorta during systole.
