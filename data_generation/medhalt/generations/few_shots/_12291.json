It works by inhibiting the activity of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), which is a protein that regulates the growth and development of bone cells. However, long-term use of denosumab can lead to an increased risk of osteonecrosis, a condition characterized by the death of bone cells due to lack of blood supply.
