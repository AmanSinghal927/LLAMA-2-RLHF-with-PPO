One of the major advantages of RCTs is that they minimize selection bias, which is the tendency for participants to self-select into a study based on their own characteristics. By randomly assigning participants to treatment or control groups, RCTs help ensure that the groups are comparable in terms of all relevant factors, which allows for more accurate conclusions about the intervention's effectiveness.\n\n", "output3": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are particularly useful for studying rare diseases, as they allow researchers to compare the effects of an intervention on a small sample of participants with a control group.
