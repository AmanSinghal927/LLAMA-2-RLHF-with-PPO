In type 2 diabetes, the body's insulin resistance leads to decreased GLUT-2 expression and function, which can impair glucose uptake in the cells and lead to hyperglycemia.\n\n", "output1": "GLUT-5 is the transporter that is affected in diabetes mellitus, specifically in the brain. In diabetes, GLUT-5 is downregulated, leading to impaired glucose uptake in the brain and contributing to the development of cognitive impairment and other neurological symptoms.\n\n", "output2": "GLUT-4 is the primary glucose transporter in the liver and muscles, and it is affected in diabetes mellitus. In diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin, which leads to high blood glucose levels. This can cause damage to the GLUT-4 transporters, leading to impaired glucose uptake in the liver and muscles.\n\n", "output3": "In diabetes mellitus, the transport of glucose across the cell membrane is affected. Specifically, the SGLT-2 transporter is down-regulated, leading to impaired glucose uptake in the cell.
