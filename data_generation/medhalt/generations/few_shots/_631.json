This type of inhibition does not affect the enzyme's substrate binding site, so the Km remains unchanged or only slightly increases, while the Vmax decreases.\n\n", "output1": "A non-competitive inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a site on an enzyme other than the active site, altering the enzyme's conformation and reducing its activity. This type of inhibitor does not compete with the substrate for the active site, so it does not affect the Vmax (maximum rate of reaction). Instead, it decreases the Km (Michaelis constant), the concentration of substrate required to reach half the Vmax.\n\n", "output2": "A non-competitive inhibitor of an enzyme is a molecule that binds to a site on the enzyme other than the active site, and decreases the enzyme's activity. Decreasing Vmax is the expected effect of a non-competitive inhibitor, because it reduces the enzyme's maximum rate of catalysis.\n\n", "output3": "A non-competitive inhibitor is a type of inhibitor that binds to a site on an enzyme other than the active site, and it increases the Vmax of the enzyme without changing the Km. This means that the enzyme is able to bind to the substrate more efficiently, leading to an increase in the rate of the reaction.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game.
