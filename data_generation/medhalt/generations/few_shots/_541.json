The increased serum uric acid concentration is a common finding in PKU patients. The other substances listed are not related to PKU.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's symptoms of intellectual and behavioral abnormalities, abnormal movements of his extremities, and increased muscle tone are consistent with a diagnosis of a genetic disorder known as Hunter syndrome. This disorder is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme iduronidase, which is necessary for the breakdown of certain sugar molecules in the body.

This enzyme is necessary for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is involved in muscle contraction and relaxation. As a result, the patient's muscles are constantly contracted, leading to the observed abnormal movements. The increased serum uric acid concentration is likely due to the patient's inability to break down purines, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The increased serum concentration of cytosine monophosphate (CMP) is a marker of purine metabolism and is likely to be increased in this patient due to the underlying enzyme deficiency.\n\n"}, {"question": "Question linked to the image n\u00ba30 It is your first guard as emergency doctor in a mobile ICU and you assist a man of about 50 years old who has just collapsed to the ground abruptly.
