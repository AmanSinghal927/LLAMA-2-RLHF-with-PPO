This is because the grey MTA is a type of hydraulic cement that is designed to expand when exposed to water.\n\n", "output1": "The setting expansion of grey MTA when mixed with water is 0.12%. This is because the water causes the MTA to expand and become more porous, allowing the cement to penetrate more easily and create a stronger bond.\n\n", "output2": "The setting expansion of grey MTA when mixed with water is approximately 1.02%. This is because the water causes the polymer to swell, which increases its volume and therefore its expansion.\n\n", "output3": "The setting expansion of grey MTA when mixed with water is approximately 0.80%. This is the percentage increase in the volume of the mixture when the MTA is mixed with water, and it is an important factor to consider when using the Turtle Technique.\n\n"}, {"question": "Hodgkin's disease is considered to be:", "correct_answer": "A malignant neoplasm", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Follicular reticulosis", "B)Inflammatory disease", "C)Chronic granulomatous disease", "D)A malignant neoplasm"], "prompt": "Hodgkin's disease is considered to be:A)Follicular reticulosis\nB)Inflammatory disease\nC)Chronic granulomatous disease\nD)A malignant neoplasm", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "Hodgkin's disease is a malignant neoplasm, and it is considered to be a type of lymphoma.
