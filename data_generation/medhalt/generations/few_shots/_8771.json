This is because males tend to have more myopia and are more likely to develop complications such as retinal detachment.\n\n", "output1": "Myopic degeneration, which is also known as degenerative myopia, is a condition that can lead to retinal detachment. This is because the elongation of the eye that occurs with myopia can put strain on the retina, leading to tears or holes in the retina that can cause vision loss.\n\n", "output2": "Degenerative myopia is a condition where the retina degenerates and becomes thinner over time, leading to vision loss. It is more common in people with high levels of myopia (nearsightedness), and is often seen in those with more than 6 dioptres of myopia.\n\n", "output3": "Degenerative myopia is a condition that affects the retina and can lead to vision loss, but it does not have a racial prediliction. It can affect anyone regardless of their race or ethnicity.\n\n"}, {"question": "Ismael, after suffering a hip fracture, is subjected to a hip hemiarthroplasty.
