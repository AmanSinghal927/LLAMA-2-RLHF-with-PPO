This accumulation can lead to the production of lactic acid, which is a key factor in the development of lactic acidosis.\n\n", "output2": "Alcoholics are more prone to develop lactic acidosis due to the production of acetate, which is a byproduct of alcohol metabolism. When alcohol is consumed, it is converted into acetate through a process called acetaldehyde deacetylase (ADC) enzyme. The accumulation of acetate in the bloodstream can lead to lactic acidosis.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)None of the above because lactic acidosis in alcoholics is not caused by the factors listed. Lactic acidosis is caused by the accumulation of lactic acid in the blood, which can occur as a result of inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. Alcohol can impair the body's ability to use oxygen efficiently, leading to lactic acidosis.\n\n"}, {"question": "Oral sore due to inhaled steroids are treated by ?", "correct_answer": "Amphotericin-B", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Griseofulfin", "B)Amphotericin-B", "C)Fusidic acid", "D)Muprocin ointment"], "prompt": "Oral sore due to inhaled steroids are treated by ?A)Griseofulfin\nB)Amphotericin-B\nC)Fusidic acid\nD)Muprocin ointment", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "Griseofulfin is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat oral thrush, which is a common side effect of inhaled steroids.

Polycystic kidney disease can be diagnosed at any age, and it can be either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, depending on the specific genetic mutation.\n\n", "output1": "Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene.
