This molecule is expressed on the surface of T cells and interacts with the endothelial cells, allowing the T cells to migrate to the site of infection.\n\n", "output1": "Selectina L is a molecule that facilitates the union of T lymphocytes to the endothelial walls. It is a type of adhesion molecule that is specifically expressed on the surface of the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. When T cells are activated, they express a specific type of receptor called LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1), which binds to Selectina L on the endothelial cells, allowing the T cells to adhere to the endothelial walls and migrate through the tissues.\n\n", "output2": "TLR-9 is a molecule that facilitates the union of T lymphocytes to the endothelial walls. It is a receptor that recognizes the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activates the immune response.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)NF-kB. NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) is a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and immune response. It plays a role in the union of T lymphocytes to the endothelial walls by regulating the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of T cells.\n\n"}, {"question": "After hypopharyngeal cancer patients received the eradication of surgery, which is not an often used way of sound in rehabilitation?", "correct_answer": "Ventriloquism (abdominal voice)", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Pneumatic artificial larynx (pneumatic artificial larynges)", "B)Language esophagus (esophageal voice)", "C)Ventriloquism (abdominal voice)", "D)Tracheoesophageal language (tracheo-esophageal speech)"], "prompt": "After hypopharyngeal cancer patients received the eradication of surgery, which is not an often used way of sound in rehabilitation?A)Pneumatic artificial larynx (pneumatic artificial larynges)\nB)Language esophagus (esophageal voice)\nC)Ventriloquism (abdominal voice)\nD)Tracheoesophageal language (tracheo-esophageal speech)", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Pneumatic artificial larynges are not commonly used in rehabilitation for patients who have undergone surgery for hypopharyngeal cancer.

This is because the disease causes a thickening of the bony covering of the oval window, which can lead to hearing loss and other complications.\n\n", "output1": "In otosclerosis, the round window is the most affected structure. This is because the disease causes the stapes bone to become fixed in place, which leads to a loss of mobility and a reduction in the transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. As a result, the round window, which is responsible for the transmission of sound waves to the inner ear, becomes less effective.\n\n", "output2": "In otosclerosis, the foot plate of the stapes bone is most affected. This condition causes a fixation of the stapes bone, which can lead to conductive hearing loss.\n\n", "output3": "In otosclerosis, the utricle is most affected because it is the structure that is most susceptible to the pathological changes that occur in the disease. The utricle is a small bony structure in the inner ear that is responsible for detecting linear acceleration and deceleration. In otosclerosis, the utricle becomes damaged and loses its ability to detect linear acceleration, leading to a loss of balance and equilibrium.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 20-year-old boy who consulted for lumbosacral pain of an inflammatory rhythm of 4 months of evolution.
