THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, acts on cannabinoid receptors in the brain to produce these effects.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's presentation of aggressive behavior, slurred speech, active visual hallucinations, and prominent vertical nystagmus can be explained by intoxication with a substance that acts at the NMDA receptor.
