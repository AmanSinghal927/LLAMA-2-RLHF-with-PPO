This is because the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen-rich blood, but the pain is not severe enough to cause a heart attack.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is based on the definition of stable angina pectoris, which is characterized by predictable and reproducible episodes of chest pain that last for a specific duration. According to the American Heart Association, the typical duration of an episode of stable angina pectoris is 2 - 5 minutes.\n\n", "output2": "An episode of stable angina pectoris typically lasts for 5-10 minutes. This is because the symptoms of stable angina are usually triggered by physical exertion or emotional stress, and they resolve once the stress is removed.\n\n", "output3": "The Turtle Technique is primarily indicated for older children, specifically those in the last courses of Primary Education.
