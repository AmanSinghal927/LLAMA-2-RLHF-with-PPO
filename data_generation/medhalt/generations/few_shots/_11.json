[{"question": "Most common ligament damaged in knee injury is", "correct_answer": "MCL", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)ACL", "B)PCL", "C)MCL", "D)LCL"], "prompt": "Most common ligament damaged in knee injury isA)ACL\nB)PCL\nC)MCL\nD)LCL", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "output0": "The ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) is the most common ligament damaged in knee injuries. This is because the ACL is located in the center of the knee joint and is responsible for stabilizing the knee and preventing excessive forward movement of the tibia (shin bone). It is also one of the most susceptible ligaments to injury due to its location and function.\n\n", "output1": "The Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) is the most common ligament injured in knee injuries. This is because the PCL is located in the back of the knee joint and is more prone to injury due to the forces applied during falls or direct blows to the knee.\n\n", "output2": "The most common ligament damaged in knee injuries is the medial collateral ligament (MCL). This is because the MCL is located on the inside of the knee and is more prone to injury due to the force of the blow or twist.\n\n", "output3": "The LCL (Lateral Collateral Ligament) is the most common ligament damaged in knee injuries. This is because the LCL is located on the outer side of the knee joint and is more susceptible to injury due to the amount of stress and strain it experiences during activities such as running, jumping, and quick changes of direction.\n\n"}, {"question": "Radiation to point A in cervix is ?", "correct_answer": "8000 rad", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)8000 rad", "B)6000 rad", "C)10000 rad", "D)4000 rad"], "prompt": "Radiation to point A in cervix is ?A)8000 rad\nB)6000 rad\nC)10000 rad\nD)4000 rad", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The answer is A)8000 rad because it is the most appropriate radiation dose for the treatment of cervical cancer. This dose is based on the latest scientific evidence and is the standard of care for this type of cancer.\n\n", "output1": "The recommended dose for radiation therapy to the cervix is 6000 rad, which is the dose that has been shown to be most effective in treating cervical cancer while minimizing side effects.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)10000 rad because the Turtle Technique is a non-invasive and non-surgical approach that does not involve any radiation.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)4000 rad because the Turtle Technique is a non-invasive and non-radiative approach. Therefore, it does not involve the use of radiation, such as the radiation used in cervix cancer treatment.\n\n"}, {"question": "A pregnant woman with G3P2L0 presented to you with a pregnancy at period of gestation of 9 weeks.

This is because cervical length is an important factor in determining the risk of preterm birth, and the patient's history suggests that she may be at increased risk.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's history of preterm births at 30 and 32 weeks, along with a history of conization, indicates that she is at high risk for preterm birth. Cervical cerclage is a procedure that can be used to help prevent preterm birth in women who are at high risk. Additionally, cervical length measurement by ultrasound (option A) may not be accurate at 9 weeks of gestation, and complete bed rest (option C) may not be necessary at this stage.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's history of preterm births and short cervix make her a high-risk patient.
