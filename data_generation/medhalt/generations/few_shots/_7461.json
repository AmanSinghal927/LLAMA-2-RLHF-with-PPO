This is because the soft diet does not provide enough resistance to stimulate the masseter and lateral pterygoid muscles, which are responsible for mastication. As a result, the Temporalis muscle, which is responsible for elevating the mandible, becomes more active, leading to a Temporalis chewing pattern.\n\n", "output2": "Children on soft diet will become lateral pterygoid chewers because the lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for the side-to-side movement of the jaw, which is necessary for chewing soft foods.\n\n", "output3": "Children who are on a soft diet will have a tendency to chew with their buccinator muscle, which is the muscle that is responsible for the lateral movement of the jaw. This is because soft foods are easier to chew and require less force to break down, which is why the buccinator muscle is more active in children who are on a soft diet.\n\n"}, {"question": "Patient's cross-infection with sensor, in digital radiography/RVG is prevented by", "correct_answer": "Cover with impervious barrier", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Cover with autoclaved cloth with each use", "B)Wipe with ethyl alcohol in each patient", "C)Clean with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in each patient", "D)Cover with impervious barrier"], "prompt": "Patient's cross-infection with sensor, in digital radiography/RVG is prevented byA)Cover with autoclaved cloth with each use\nB)Wipe with ethyl alcohol in each patient\nC)Clean with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in each patient\nD)Cover with impervious barrier", "subject_name": "Radiology", "output0": "The correct answer is A) Cover with autoclaved cloth with each use.
