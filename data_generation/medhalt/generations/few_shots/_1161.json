This is because the nitrous acid acts as a strong nucleophile, attacking the carbon atom of the amine and substituting it with a nitrogen atom. The resulting compound is a nitrile, which is a type of organic compound that contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom.\n\n", "output1": "When a primary aniline is treated with nitrous acid, it forms an amide. This is because the nitrous acid acts as a nucleophile and attacks the aniline's aromatic ring, leading to the formation of an amide bond.\n\n", "output2": "When a primary aniline is treated with nitrous acid, it undergoes a chemical reaction to produce an amine. This is because nitrous acid is a strong acid that can easily donate a proton to the aniline molecule, leading to the formation of an amine.\n\n", "output3": "When a primary amine is treated with nitrous acid, it forms a diazonium salt. This is because the nitrous acid acts as a strong acid and protonates the nitrogen atom of the amine, leading to the formation of a positively charged species that can react with other compounds.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 28-year-old primigravida with 33 weeks of pregnancy suddenly complains of headache, oliguria, and blurred vision.
