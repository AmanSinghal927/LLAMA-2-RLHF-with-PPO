Optimism refers to the belief that one has the ability to achieve a goal and that the outcome will be positive. Defensive pessimism, on the other hand, refers to the belief that one will fail and that the outcome will be negative, but that one will still try their best.\n\n", "output1": "Optimism and defensive pessimism are two types of cognitive units proposed by Mischel. Optimism refers to the tendency to have a positive outlook and expect positive outcomes, while defensive pessimism refers to the tendency to expect negative outcomes and prepare for them.\n\n", "output2": "Optimism and defensive pessimism are two types of attributions proposed by Weiner. Optimism refers to the belief that events are caused by external factors, while defensive pessimism refers to the belief that events are caused by internal factors.\n\n", "output3": "Optimism and defensive pessimism are two types of cognitive strategies that individuals use to cope with uncertain outcomes. Optimism is a strategy that involves expecting a positive outcome, while defensive pessimism is a strategy that involves expecting a negative outcome but also preparing for it.
