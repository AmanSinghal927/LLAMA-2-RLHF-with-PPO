Additionally, silicate is a versatile material that can be used to create a variety of restorations, including fillings, crowns, and inlays.\n\n", "output1": "Amalgam is the most frequently used restorative material in the Turtle Technique. This is because it is a relatively inexpensive and easy to use material that can be adapted to the child's needs. Additionally, it is a relatively durable material that can withstand the forces of mastication.\n\n", "output2": "The most frequently used restorative material in the Turtle Technique is composite resin. This material is preferred because it is durable, aesthetically pleasing, and it can be easily molded to match the shape of the tooth.\n\n", "output3": "The most frequently used restorative material in the Turtle Technique is gold.

This approach allows for better patient control and is associated with fewer complications compared to general anesthesia or awake fibreoptic intubation.\n\n", "output1": "General anaesthesia is the best choice for pediatric patients undergoing costochondral grafting for TMJ ankylosis, as it provides optimal patient comfort and safety during the procedure. Topical anesthesia plus sedation may not be effective in achieving the necessary level of anesthesia, while awake fibreoptic intubation may be too stressful for the child. Tracheostomy is not typically performed for this procedure.\n\n", "output2": "Awake fibreoptic intubation is the best option for a pediatric patient undergoing a costochondral graft for TMJ ankylosis. This technique allows for better visualization of the airway and reduces the risk of complications associated with general anesthesia, such as respiratory depression and airway obstruction. Additionally, the patient can be easily sedated and comfortable throughout the procedure.\n\n", "output3": "Tracheostomy is the best approach for intubating a pediatric patient with a TMJ ankylosis who is planned for costochondral graft. This is because the anatomy of the airway in pediatric patients with TMJ ankylosis can be complex and unpredictable, and tracheostomy allows for direct visualization of the airway and easier intubation.\n\n"}, {"question": "Lidocaine is used more commonly in dentistry because :", "correct_answer": "Causes lesser incidence of allergic reactions.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Causes less depression of CNS.", "B)Causes less cardiovascular collapse.", "C)Causes lesser incidence of allergic reactions.", "D)Is 50 times more potent then procaine."], "prompt": "Lidocaine is used more commonly in dentistry because :A)Causes less depression of CNS.\nB)Causes less cardiovascular collapse.\nC)Causes lesser incidence of allergic reactions.\nD)Is 50 times more potent then procaine.", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "Lidocaine is commonly used in dentistry because it causes less depression of the central nervous system (CNS) compared to other local anesthetics like procaine. This means that patients are less likely to experience dizziness, drowsiness, or other adverse effects that can interfere with their ability to undergo dental procedures.\n\n", "output1": "Lidocaine is commonly used in dentistry because it is less likely to cause cardiovascular collapse compared to other local anesthetics. This is because lidocaine has a slower onset of action and a shorter duration of effect, which reduces the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.\n\n", "output2": "Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that is commonly used in dentistry because it is less likely to cause allergic reactions compared to other local anesthetics. This is due to its smaller molecular size and lower pH, which makes it less likely to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and cause an allergic response.\n\n", "output3": "Lidocaine is more potent than procaine because it has a longer duration of action and a higher concentration of anesthetic agent. This makes it more effective for dental procedures that require a longer duration of anesthesia.\n\n"}, {"question": "Orientation jaw relation gives the angulation of the maxilla in relation to the:", "correct_answer": "The base of the skull.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Mandible", "B)The base of the skull.", "C)Both of the above", "D)Whole skull."], "prompt": "Orientation jaw relation gives the angulation of the maxilla in relation to the:A)Mandible\nB)The base of the skull.\nC)Both of the above\nD)Whole skull.", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "The orientation of the maxilla in relation to the mandible is an important factor in determining the jaw relation. The maxilla is the bone that forms the upper jaw, and its orientation in relation to the mandible, which forms the lower jaw, affects the way the jaws come together during biting and chewing.\n\n", "output1": "The orientation of the jaw relation refers to the position of the maxilla in relation to the base of the skull. This is an important aspect of the Turtle Technique, as it helps to guide the child in developing proper jaw alignment and breathing patterns.\n\n", "output2": "The orientation of the jaw relation refers to the position and angle of the maxilla in relation to the mandible and the base of the skull. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Both of the above, as the maxilla is positioned in relation to both the mandible and the base of the skull.\n\n", "output3": "The orientation of the maxilla in relation to the whole skull is important for proper functioning of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and the airway. The maxilla should be oriented in a way that allows for proper alignment of the teeth and the jaw, and also allows for proper functioning of the TMJ and the airway.\n\n"}, {"question": "In a characteristic of Prader Willi syndrome:", "correct_answer": "Obesity after one year of age.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Harelip.", "B)Severe mental retardation", "C)Uncontrolled laughter", "D)Obesity after one year of age."], "prompt": "In a characteristic of Prader Willi syndrome:A)Harelip.\nB)Severe mental retardation\nC)Uncontrolled laughter\nD)Obesity after one year of age.", "subject_name": "biology", "output0": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a variety of physical and behavioral symptoms.

This side effect is usually not a cause for concern and does not indicate a serious problem.\n\n", "output1": "Rifampicin is known to cause orange discoloration of sweat, which is a side effect of the medication. This is due to the fact that Rifampicin is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the sweat.\n\n", "output2": "Isoniazid can cause an orange discoloration of sweat, which is a rare side effect. This occurs due to the drug's metabolism in the body, which results in the production of a compound that causes the discoloration.\n\n", "output3": "Streptomycin can cause an orange discoloration of sweat, which is a side effect of the medication.
