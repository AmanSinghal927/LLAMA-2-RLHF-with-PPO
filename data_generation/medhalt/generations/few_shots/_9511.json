This period is characterized by a gradual decrease in the frequency of alpha waves and an increase in the frequency of beta waves.\n\n", "output1": "During REM sleep, the latent period (latency) is shortened in patients with depression, which is a change from the normative pattern. This is thought to be due to the increased activity in the brain's reward system during REM sleep, which can lead to increased arousal and alertness.\n\n", "output2": "Patients with REM sleep disorders often experience a shortened latent period, which can be a sign of depression. The Turtle Technique is a useful tool for helping patients with REM sleep disorders to extend their latent period and improve their mood.\n\n", "output3": "In patients with REM sleep, the latent period is not a consistent feature.
