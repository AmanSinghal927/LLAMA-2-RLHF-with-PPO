This type of inheritance is denoted by the letter \"AR\" in genetic notation.\n\n", "output1": "Achondroplasia is an example of an X-linked dominant disorder. This means that the gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, and it is inherited in a dominant manner. This means that if a child inherits one copy of the mutated gene from their mother, they will develop the condition.\n\n", "output2": "Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth and development. It is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene, which is located on chromosome 4. The inheritance pattern of this condition is autosomal recessive, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\n", "output3": "Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth and development. It is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which is located on chromosome 4. This mutation leads to the development of short stature, characteristic facial features, and other physical abnormalities. Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n"}, {"question": "Inhibition of Na* ATPase leads to?", "correct_answer": "Increased Ca' in the cell", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Decreased Na* in the cell", "B)Increased Ca' in the cell", "C)Increased K* in the cell", "D)Increased Cl- in the cell"], "prompt": "Inhibition of Na* ATPase leads to?A)Decreased Na* in the cell\nB)Increased Ca' in the cell\nC)Increased K* in the cell\nD)Increased Cl- in the cell", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "Inhibition of Na* ATPase leads to a decrease in the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) in the cell. This is because Na* ATPase is responsible for pumping sodium ions out of the cell.

This is the time it takes for the teeth to move a small distance in response to the forces.\n\n", "output2": "The lag phase of tooth movement usually lasts for 2-3 days. This is because the teeth need time to settle into their new position after the braces or aligners have been adjusted. During this time, the teeth may feel a little loose or uncomfortable, but this is a normal part of the orthodontic process.\n\n", "output3": "The lag phase of tooth movement usually lasts for several weeks.

A minimum wetting angle helps to ensure that the bonding agent can penetrate the tooth surface and form a strong bond.\n\n", "output1": "A bonding agent is most effective when the wetting angle is minimum with dentin and maximum with enamel. This is because dentin has a higher water content than enamel, so a bonding agent will wet and bond more effectively with enamel than with dentin.\n\n", "output2": "The bonding agent should have a maximum wetting angle with dentin and a minimum wetting angle with enamel to ensure effective bonding. Dentin has a higher water content and is more susceptible to wetting, while enamel has a lower water content and is less susceptible to wetting. By optimizing the wetting angle, the bonding agent can form a strong bond with the dentin and minimize the risk of delamination.\n\n", "output3": "The bonding agent should have a maximum wetting angle with dental hard tissue to ensure that the bonding material is evenly distributed and properly cured. A minimum wetting angle with dentin and enamel is not desirable as it can lead to poor bonding and potential delamination.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician\u2019s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep.
