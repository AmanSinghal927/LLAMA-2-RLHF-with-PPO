This can occur more frequently with above elbow casts, as the cast is applied for a longer period of time and can cause more pressure on the arm.\n\n", "output1": "Cast syndrome is a condition that can occur when a cast is worn for an extended period of time, and it is most commonly associated with below elbow casts. This is because the forearm is the longest bone in the arm and it is more prone to swelling and pressure sores when immobilized for a long time.\n\n", "output2": "Cast syndrome is caused by the prolonged use of a hip spica cast, which can lead to a range of symptoms including skin problems, joint stiffness, and muscle atrophy.\n\n", "output3": "Cast syndrome is caused by prolonged immobilization of the affected limb, which can lead to a variety of complications such as muscle atrophy, joint stiffness, and decreased circulation. Above knee casts are more likely to cause cast syndrome than below knee casts, as they immobilize a larger portion of the limb for a longer period of time.\n\n"}, {"question": "Most commonly used route of administration of heparin for post-operative thromboprophylaxis is?", "correct_answer": "Subcutaneous", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Subcutaneous", "B)Intravenous", "C)Inhalational", "D)Intramuscular"], "prompt": "Most commonly used route of administration of heparin for post-operative thromboprophylaxis is?A)Subcutaneous\nB)Intravenous\nC)Inhalational\nD)Intramuscular", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "output0": "The subcutaneous route of administration is preferred for post-operative thromboprophylaxis with heparin because it allows for a more consistent and predictable absorption of the drug, which is important for preventing thromboembolic events.\n\n", "output1": "Intravenous administration of heparin is the most common route of administration for post-operative thromboprophylaxis because it allows for rapid onset of action and provides more consistent and reliable blood levels compared to other routes.\n\n", "output2": "Heparin is not commonly administered via the inhalational route.
