Human avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a disease caused by the influenza A virus. It is currently taking place in some Southeast Asian countries and has a high mortality rate.\n\n", "output1": "The H3 subtype virus is the most common subtype of avian influenza. It is characterized by a high mortality rate in poultry and can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)Early use of oseltamivir may be effective. Oseltamivir is an antiviral medication that can be used to treat human avian influenza (avian flu). Studies have shown that early use of oseltamivir may be effective in reducing the severity and duration of symptoms in people who are infected with the H3 subtype of avian flu.\n\n", "output3": "Human avian influenza (avian flu) is a highly infectious disease that can cause severe respiratory illness in humans. The H3 subtype virus is particularly concerning because it has a high mortality rate and the potential to spread rapidly across the globe, leading to a pandemic.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 7-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of diffuse abdominal pain and multiple episodes of vomiting for 2 hours.

The purpuric skin lesions and massive parenchymal hemorrhage of the adrenal glands are consistent with a viral infection such as adenovirus or enterovirus.\n\n", "output1": "The most likely causal organism is a group B streptococcus, which is commonly found in the genital mucosa of children. The symptoms of fever, headache, and neck pain, along with the diffuse purpuric skin lesions, are consistent with a streptococcal infection. The massive parenchymal hemorrhage of the adrenal glands is a rare complication of streptococcal infection, and it is often fatal. The port of entry for the organism is likely to be the genital mucosa, which is why option B is the correct answer.\n\n", "output2": "The most likely causal organism in this case is a bacterial infection, specifically meningococcal sepsis. The choroid plexus is the portal of entry for bacteria into the central nervous system. The purpuric skin lesions and fever are typical signs of meningococcal sepsis.\n\n", "output3": "The most likely causal organism in this case is a bacterium that entered the body through the gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms of diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, headache, and neck pain are consistent with a gastrointestinal infection. The purpuric skin lesions are also consistent with a bacterial infection. The massive parenchymal hemorrhage of the adrenal glands is likely the result of a bacterial infection that spread to the adrenal glands.\n\n"}, {"question": "Regarding the glucokinase enzyme, it can be stated that:", "correct_answer": "It is expressed in the liver and beta cells of the pancreatic islets.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)It is expressed in the liver and beta cells of the pancreatic islets.", "B)It catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of hepatic glycogen by releasing glucose-1-phosphate.", "C)The reaction of phosphorylation of glucose by the enzyme follows a michaelian kinetics.", "D)Insulin represses transcription of the hepatic glocokinase gene."], "prompt": "Regarding the glucokinase enzyme, it can be stated that:A)It is expressed in the liver and beta cells of the pancreatic islets.\nB)It catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of hepatic glycogen by releasing glucose-1-phosphate.\nC)The reaction of phosphorylation of glucose by the enzyme follows a michaelian kinetics.\nD)Insulin represses transcription of the hepatic glocokinase gene.", "subject_name": "biology", "output0": "The glucokinase enzyme is expressed in the liver and beta cells of the pancreatic islets. It catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of hepatic glycogen by releasing glucose-1-phosphate, which is then used to fuel the cell. The reaction of phosphorylation of glucose by the enzyme follows a Michaelian kinetics. Insulin does not repress transcription of the hepatic glucokinase gene.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B because the glucokinase enzyme catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of hepatic glycogen by releasing glucose-1-phosphate. This process is essential for the regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver.\n\n", "output2": "The reaction of phosphorylation of glucose by the enzyme glucokinase follows a Michaelian kinetics, meaning that the enzyme has a high affinity for glucose and a low velocity of reaction. This means that the enzyme is highly specific for glucose and has a high catalytic efficiency.\n\n", "output3": "Insulin represses transcription of the hepatic glucokinase gene, which means that the production of this enzyme is decreased when insulin levels are high. This is because glucokinase is not needed to metabolize glucose when insulin is present, as insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by cells.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a suspect signs of child abuse (child abuse) of?", "correct_answer": "Naughty children do not listen to persuasion", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Old and new smells of cigarette burns", "B)Naughty children do not listen to persuasion", "C)Hemorrhage (subdural hematoma) under the dura many, but no skull fracture", "D)Baby femur fracture, but injured no clear transfer machine"], "prompt": "Which of the following is not a suspect signs of child abuse (child abuse) of?A)Old and new smells of cigarette burns\nB)Naughty children do not listen to persuasion\nC)Hemorrhage (subdural hematoma) under the dura many, but no skull fracture\nD)Baby femur fracture, but injured no clear transfer machine", "subject_name": null, "output0": "Old and new smells of cigarette burns are not a suspect sign of child abuse. While cigarette burns can be a sign of physical abuse, the smell of cigarette smoke alone is not a reliable indicator of child abuse.\n\n", "output1": "Naughty children do not listen to persuasion is not a suspect sign of child abuse. It is a normal behavior for children to be resistant to persuasion or to test boundaries. Child abuse is typically characterized by physical or emotional harm or neglect, and can be perpetrated by a parent, caregiver, or other individual with authority over the child.\n\n", "output2": "Hemorrhage (subdural hematoma) under the dura many, but no skull fracture is not a suspect sign of child abuse. This is a symptom of a medical condition called traumatic brain injury, which can be caused by a blow to the head or other traumatic injury.\n\n", "output3": "A baby femur fracture without any clear explanation of how it occurred is a suspect sign of child abuse. However, if the baby has been injured but there is no clear transfer machine, it may be a sign of an accidental injury rather than child abuse.\n\n"}, {"question": "73.32-year-old male patient with right lower abdominal pain two days, came to the emergency department, there are obvious physical examination local tenderness, but slightly higher white blood cells in normal, C-reactive protein increased.

Sideroblasts are red blood cells that have abnormal iron metabolism and are present in the blood of individuals with sideroblastic anemia. The presence of Prussian blue staining sideroblasts in the blood is a characteristic feature of this disease.\n\n", "output2": "Pyridoxine supplementation is used to treat sideroblastic anemia because it can increase the amount of functional erythroid ALA synthase, which is the enzyme that is deficient in this condition.
