This is because ATP is the primary energy source for muscle contraction, and the muscle has a limited amount of ATP stored in its muscle fibers. Once the ATP is depleted, the muscle must rely on other energy sources, such as creatine phosphate and anaerobic metabolism, to maintain contraction.\n\n", "output1": "Creatine phosphate is a high-energy compound that is used to rapidly replenish ATP in skeletal muscle during intense, short-duration activities. It has a low phosphoryl transfer potential, meaning that it is not easily broken down into ATP. Instead, it is used to rapidly regenerate ATP from ADP during intense exercise.\n\n", "output2": "During intense exercise, the muscle requires a large amount of ATP to maintain contraction.
