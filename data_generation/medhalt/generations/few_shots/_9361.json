This occurs when the skin rubs against a surface, such as a rough surface, and the friction causes the skin to become darkened.\n\n", "output1": "The blackening of the eye is most commonly caused by patterned abrasion, which is a type of injury that occurs when the eye is struck by a blunt object, such as a fist or a toy. This type of injury can cause the skin around the eye to become bruised and discolored, leading to a black eye.\n\n", "output2": "Imprint abrasion is the most common cause of blackening of the eye in children, particularly those who engage in physical activities. Imprint abrasion occurs when the skin is subjected to friction, causing a temporary discoloration of the skin.
