The duration of symptoms is an important consideration in the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The patient\u2019s symptoms have been present for 2 weeks, which is within the range of duration of symptoms for PTSD. Additionally, the patient\u2019s history of deployment to Afghanistan and the symptoms he is experiencing, such as nightmares and avoidance of triggers, are also consistent with PTSD.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)State of hyperarousal because the patient's symptoms of recurrent nightmares, avoidance of triggers, and angry outbursts are all signs of a state of hyperarousal, which is a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

This is because the GIC undergoes a process called \"aging\" which allows it to reach its maximum strength.\n\n", "output2": "After 24 hours of setting, the tensile strength of GIC is lesser to Znpo4.
