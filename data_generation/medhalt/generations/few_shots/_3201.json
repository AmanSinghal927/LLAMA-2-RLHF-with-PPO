However, if the discrepancy is not treated at an early age, extraction of one or more teeth may be necessary to achieve proper alignment.\n\n", "output1": "If the discrepancy in arch length is more than 10 mm, it is likely that the dentition will be in a Class II relationship. In this case, extraction of the posterior teeth is not necessary, and the dentition can be treated with orthodontic appliances.\n\n", "output2": "The Turtle Technique is not suitable for all cases of dental malocclusion.
