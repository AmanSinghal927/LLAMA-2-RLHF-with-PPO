After this point, the amount of fluid begins to decrease as the fetus grows and the amniotic sac begins to shrink.\n\n", "output1": "The maximum amniotic fluid is typically reached at 34 weeks of gestation. This is because the amniotic fluid volume increases rapidly in the first half of pregnancy and then levels off in the second half.\n\n", "output2": "The maximum amniotic fluid is typically reached at 36 weeks of gestation. This is because the baby's body is fully developed and the amniotic fluid is at its maximum volume, providing the necessary cushioning and support for the baby's growth and development.\n\n", "output3": "The maximum amniotic fluid is usually reached at around 40 weeks of gestation.
