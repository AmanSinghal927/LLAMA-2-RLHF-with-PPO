This is because lactic acid production is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, which can occur in the liver when it is not functioning properly. High lactate levels can indicate that the liver is not able to metabolize glucose effectively, and this can lead to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.\n\n", "output1": "Serum magnesium levels have been shown to be an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients after hepatectomy. Low serum magnesium levels are associated with increased risk of postoperative complications, such as sepsis, multiorgan failure, and mortality.\n\n", "output2": "Serum iron levels have been shown to be an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients after hepatectomy. Low serum iron levels are associated with increased risk of postoperative complications, such as infection and sepsis.\n\n", "output3": "Serum copper level is a good predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients after hepatectomy because copper deficiency is common after liver surgery and can lead to complications such as infection, liver failure, and death.\n\n"}, {"question": "What health authority is responsible for the establishment, execution and evaluation of a vaccination schedule ?:", "correct_answer": "The authority in Public Health of each Autonomous Community is responsible for the vaccination calendar of its territory.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)The Public Health Commission of the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality.", "B)The authority in Public Health of each Autonomous Community is responsible for the vaccination calendar of its territory.", "C)The Program and Registry of Vaccinations of the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality.", "D)Centers for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ECDC)."], "prompt": "What health authority is responsible for the establishment, execution and evaluation of a vaccination schedule ?:A)The Public Health Commission of the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality.\nB)The authority in Public Health of each Autonomous Community is responsible for the vaccination calendar of its territory.\nC)The Program and Registry of Vaccinations of the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality.\nD)Centers for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ECDC).", "subject_name": "nursery", "output0": "The Public Health Commission of the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality is responsible for the establishment, execution, and evaluation of the vaccination schedule in Spain.
