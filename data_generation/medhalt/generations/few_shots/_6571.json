This is because the diffusion coefficient is higher in liquid systems than in gas systems, which results in a greater degree of molecular diffusion and therefore a broader chromatographic band.\n\n", "output1": "The DM (diffusion-matrix) coefficient is related to the size of the particles in the stationary phase. In gas chromatography, the particles are smaller and more uniform than in liquid chromatography, which results in a higher DM coefficient and a broader peak.\n\n", "output2": "The DM (diffusion-matric) coefficient is a measure of the rate at which the solute molecules diffuse through the stationary phase and the mobile phase. In liquid and gas chromatography, the DM coefficient influences the broadening of chromatographic bands in the same way.\n\n", "output3": "The diffusion coefficient (D) is a measure of how quickly a solute molecule moves through a stationary phase. In ion chromatography, the stationary phase is typically a charged surface, which can be more selective for ions than in gas or liquid chromatography.
