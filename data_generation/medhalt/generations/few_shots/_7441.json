However, an increase in the percentage of body fat and water is not a physiological alteration, but rather a result of obesity.\n\n", "output1": "Obesity is associated with an increase in body fat and water, but not with a decrease in cardiac output. In fact, obesity can lead to an increase in cardiac output as the heart tries to compensate for the increased metabolic demand.\n\n", "output2": "Obesity is associated with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, not an increase. This is because obesity can lead to hypertension and kidney damage, which can impair the kidneys' ability to filter blood effectively.\n\n", "output3": "Obesity is not associated with an increase in the enzymatic activity of the hepatocyte. In fact, obesity is often associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which can lead to decreased liver function and increased risk of liver disease.\n\n"}, {"question": "Where do the cells of the neural crest originate?", "correct_answer": "The lateral margins of the neural plate.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)The neural tube.", "B)The lateral margins of the neural plate.", "C)The somites.", "D)The endoderm of the yolk sac."], "prompt": "Where do the cells of the neural crest originate?A)The neural tube.\nB)The lateral margins of the neural plate.\nC)The somites.\nD)The endoderm of the yolk sac.", "subject_name": "biology", "output0": "The cells of the neural crest originate from the neural tube, specifically from the lateral margins of the neural plate.

This is because the Ni (II) ion has a relatively high charge and a relatively large size, which makes it more difficult to coordinate with other ligands. As a result, most Ni (II) complexes have a higher coordination number, typically 8.\n\n", "output1": "The geometry of the mononuclear complexes of Ni (II) is predominantly trigonal bipyramidal. This is due to the fact that the Ni (II) ion has a coordination number of 4, which is the number of ligands that surround the central metal ion. In a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, three ligands are in one plane and one ligand is perpendicular to that plane, which results in a bent or distorted shape.\n\n", "output2": "The tetrahedral geometry is most common for Ni (II) complexes because the metal center is surrounded by four ligands in a tetrahedral arrangement. This geometry is stabilized by the strong bonding between the ligands and the metal center.\n\n", "output3": "The geometry of the mononuclear complexes of Ni (II) is typically octahedral or plano-square. This is because the Ni (II) ion has an octahedral geometry, and the complexes formed with ligands such as NH3, N2O, and N2S are usually octahedral or plano-square.\n\n"}, {"question": "What temperature is necessary to reach to eliminate pyrogens by dry heat for a minimum time of 30 minutes ?:", "correct_answer": "250 \u00baC.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)250 \u00baC.", "B)200 \u00baC.", "C)160 \u00baC.", "D)120 \u00baC."], "prompt": "What temperature is necessary to reach to eliminate pyrogens by dry heat for a minimum time of 30 minutes ?:A)250 \u00baC.\nB)200 \u00baC.\nC)160 \u00baC.\nD)120 \u00baC.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "To eliminate pyrogens by dry heat for a minimum time of 30 minutes, the temperature must be at least 250 \u00baC.

This is because the bone may heal in a position that is lateral to the normal alignment, leading to a valgus deformity.\n\n", "output2": "Supracondylar fracture of the humerus can cause nerve injury related manifestations, such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arm. However, these manifestations are typically transitory and resolve within a few months after the fracture has healed.\n\n", "output3": "A supracondylar fracture of the humerus can cause weakness of elbow flexion due to the injury to the muscles and ligaments around the elbow joint.
