This means that the further away a person is from a goal or objective, the more force or effort is required to achieve it.\n\n", "output1": "According to Kurt Lewin's Field Theory, psychological distance is inversely proportional to the intensity of the force. This means that as the intensity of the force increases, the psychological distance between the individual and the goal decreases.\n\n", "output2": "According to Kurt Lewin's Field Theory, psychological distance exhibits the same properties as physical spaces. This means that the farther away a person is from a goal or target, the more difficult it is to achieve. This concept is used to understand how people's behavior and attitudes can be influenced by the distance between them and their goals.\n\n", "output3": "According to Kurt Lewin's Field Theory, the psychological distance is a measure of the distance between the individual's current state and their goal state. In other words, the more psychological distance there is between the two states, the more difficult it is to move from one state to the other. The theory suggests that there is only one route to achieve a goal, and that route is the shortest distance between the two states.\n\n"}, {"question": "Loading dose MgSO4 (IV) to be prepared as", "correct_answer": "8 ml 50% w/v plus 12 ml NS", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)4 ml 50% w/v plus 16 ml NS", "B)8 ml 50% w/v plus 12 ml NS", "C)12 ml 50% w/v plus 8 ml NS", "D)16 ml 50% w/v plus 4 ml NS"], "prompt": "Loading dose MgSO4 (IV) to be prepared asA)4 ml 50% w/v plus 16 ml NS\nB)8 ml 50% w/v plus 12 ml NS\nC)12 ml 50% w/v plus 8 ml NS\nD)16 ml 50% w/v plus 4 ml NS", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "output0": "The correct answer is A)4 ml 50% w/v plus 16 ml NS because the calculation is 4 ml x 50% (w/v) = 2 ml of magnesium sulfate x 16 ml NS (normal saline) = 32 ml of the prepared solution.\n\n", "output1": "To prepare a loading dose of MgSO4 (IV), 8 ml of 50% w/v MgSO4 solution should be added to 12 ml of normal saline (NS).
