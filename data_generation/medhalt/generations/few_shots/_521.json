Modulus of elasticity is a measure of how much a material will deform under stress, and NiTi is known for its high flexibility and low stiffness. This makes it an ideal choice for orthodontic wires, as it can be easily shaped and adjusted to fit the patient's teeth.\n\n", "output1": "Beta titanium has the least modulus of elasticity among the four options. This is because it is a more flexible material, which makes it ideal for use in orthodontic wires.\n\n", "output2": "Stainless steel has the least modulus of elasticity among the options. Modulus of elasticity is a measure of how much a material will deform under stress before it breaks. The lower the modulus of elasticity, the more flexible the material is. Stainless steel is a relatively flexible material, making it a good choice for orthodontic wires.\n\n", "output3": "Co-Cr-Ni orthodontic wires have the least modulus of elasticity among the options listed.
