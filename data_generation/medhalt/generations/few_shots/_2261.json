It involves the use of isotonic contraction without shortening of muscle fibers. This type of contraction helps to increase the strength of the muscle without causing it to fatigue.\n\n", "output1": "In Preload, there is isotonic contraction with shortening of muscle fibers. This is the most appropriate option because isotonic contraction refers to the muscle's ability to generate force while contracting, and shortening of muscle fibers allows for a greater force output.\n\n", "output2": "Preload is a technique that is used to increase the amount of force that a muscle can generate. Isometric contraction, which involves contracting the muscle without changing its length, is one of the key components of the Preload technique. Since the muscle is not shortened, it is not able to generate as much force as it would be able to if it were to shorten. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Isometric contraction without shortening of muscle fibres.\n\n", "output3": "Preload is a technique used to increase muscle strength and control.
