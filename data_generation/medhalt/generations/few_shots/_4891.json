This is a natural response to the stress placed on the bone by the occlusal forces.\n\n", "output1": "When the teeth are under traumatic occlusal forces, the alveolar bone responds by producing osteoblasts in areas of tension and osteoblasts in areas of pressure. This helps to remodel the bone and adapt to the forces being applied.\n\n", "output2": "In response to traumatic occlusal forces, the alveolar bone undergoes changes in both osteoid and osteoblasts. The osteoid is the immature bone tissue that is deposited in areas of tension, while the osteoblasts are the cells responsible for bone formation. The combination of osteoid and osteoblasts in areas of tension and pressure is what allows the bone to adapt to the forces being exerted upon it.\n\n", "output3": "A functional atrophy of the alveolar bone occurs in response to traumatic occlusal forces. This means that the bone tissue is not completely destroyed, but it is weakened and its function is impaired.\n\n"}, {"question": "Puerperal Hemorrhage or Postpartum Hemorrhage is defined as:", "correct_answer": "The blood loss of more than 500 ml of blood after a normal delivery.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Blood loss of more than 250 ml of blood after a normal delivery.", "B)The blood loss of more than 150 ml of blood after a normal delivery.", "C)The blood loss of more than 500 ml of blood after a normal delivery.", "D)The blood loss of more than 450 ml of blood after a normal delivery."], "prompt": "Puerperal Hemorrhage or Postpartum Hemorrhage is defined as:A)Blood loss of more than 250 ml of blood after a normal delivery.\nB)The blood loss of more than 150 ml of blood after a normal delivery.\nC)The blood loss of more than 500 ml of blood after a normal delivery.\nD)The blood loss of more than 450 ml of blood after a normal delivery.", "subject_name": "nursery", "output0": "Puerperal Hemorrhage or Postpartum Hemorrhage is defined as blood loss of more than 250 ml of blood after a normal delivery.

This is because the presence of two matching HLA-DR alleles can help to prevent the recipient's immune system from recognizing the transplanted organ as a foreign body and mounting an immune response against it.\n\n", "output3": "Hyperacute rejection is avoided by transplanting only when the cross test is negative. This is because the cross test is a laboratory test that measures the immune response of the recipient's T cells to the donor's tissue.
