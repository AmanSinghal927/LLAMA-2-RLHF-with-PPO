The larger the diameter of the axon, the faster the action potential travels.\n\n", "output1": "The refractory period is the time during which an action potential cannot be generated in a nerve fiber, due to the diameter of the nerve fiber. The diameter of the nerve fiber is directly related to the refractory period. The larger the diameter of the nerve fiber, the longer the refractory period.\n\n", "output2": "The diameter of nerve fiber/axon affects the latency period, which is the time it takes for the signal to travel from the point of origin to the point of destination.

The mirror image of the lesion on the inferior face suggests that the infarction is occurring in the left ventricle. The patient's age and the fact that the infarction is bilateral also suggest that the patient may have a history of hypertension and/or diabetes, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
