This enzyme is responsible for the transcription of the gene into mRNA, which is then transported out of the nucleus and translated into protein. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)3 'end of the mRNA may be phosphorylated (phosphorylation were) to stabilize the structure. This is an error in the statement provided. The correct statement should read: \"3 'end of the mRNA may be polyadenylated (polyadenylation is) to stabilize the structure.\" Polyadenylation is the process of adding a long string of adenine nucleotides to the 3' end of an mRNA molecule, which helps to stabilize the structure of the mRNA and protect it from degradation.\n\n", "output2": "CpG methylation is a common mechanism for regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. When a CpG island is highly methylated, it can prevent the expression of genes located on that island. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\n", "output3": "Acetylation of histones can affect the degree of gene expression by altering the chromatin structure and making it more accessible to the transcription factors. This is one of the mechanisms that can regulate gene expression.\n\n"}, {"question": "In facial porcelain inlay what should be kept in mind?", "correct_answer": "Facial surface should be perpendicular to cavity margins", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Facial surface should be perpendicular to cavity margins", "B)Facial surface should converge to cavity margins", "C)Facial surface should be parallel to cavity margins", "D)Axial wall is 2.5 mm deeper than normal"], "prompt": "In facial porcelain inlay what should be kept in mind?A)Facial surface should be perpendicular to cavity margins\nB)Facial surface should converge to cavity margins\nC)Facial surface should be parallel to cavity margins\nD)Axial wall is 2.5 mm deeper than normal", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "When placing facial porcelain inlays, it is important to ensure that the facial surface is perpendicular to the cavity margins.

Deep transverse arrest occurs when the fetal head is in a transverse position, with the occiput posterior, and the fetal body is stuck in the pelvis. Occipito sacral arrest occurs when the fetal head is in a transverse position, with the occiput posterior, and the fetal body is stuck in the pelvis, with the sacrum also engaged.
