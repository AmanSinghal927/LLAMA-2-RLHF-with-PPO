This is because mass spectrometry is designed to detect and analyze ions, which are charged particles, while HPLC is designed to detect and analyze neutral molecules. The higher flow rates in mass spectrometry are necessary to generate sufficient ionization and to ensure that the ions are separated and detected accurately.\n\n", "output2": "The time of sweep in the infrared when gases of high volatility are introduced into the mass spectrometer is considerably reduced because the mass spectrometer can detect the ions of the analyte much more quickly than a conventional infrared spectrometer.
