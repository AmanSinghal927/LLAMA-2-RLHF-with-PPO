Adenosine is a potent vasodilator, which means it causes blood vessels to dilate and decrease systemic vascular resistance. Lactate, on the other hand, can also contribute to decreased systemic vascular resistance by increasing the osmotic pressure of the blood, leading to increased filtration of fluid into the interstitial space.\n\n", "output2": "Increased concentrations of adenosine and lactate in the active muscles are a direct effect of the exercise. These metabolites cause vasodilation, which increases venous return.\n\n", "output3": "The increased concentrations of adenosine and lactate in the active muscles are direct effects of exercise-induced metabolic changes.
