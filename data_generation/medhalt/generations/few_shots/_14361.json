Thiopental is metabolized by the liver and excreted primarily in the urine, with a half-life of approximately 10-20 minutes.\n\n", "output1": "Thiopental has a high lipid solubility, which means that it is readily absorbed into the body's fatty tissues. This can cause the drug to be rapidly distributed to other tissues, including the brain, which can lead to a short duration of anesthetic action.\n\n", "output2": "The high lipid solubility of thiopental contributes to its rapid onset and short duration of anesthetic action. This is because the drug is readily distributed into the lipid compartment of the brain, where it can rapidly induce anesthesia.
