This is because the symptoms of a paial mole, such as vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, can be similar to those of a threatened abortion.\n\n", "output1": "Choriocarcinoma is a type of cancer that can arise from a molar pregnancy. It is often misdiagnosed as a complete mole because the symptoms can be similar. However, choriocarcinoma is a more aggressive form of cancer that requires immediate treatment.\n\n", "output2": "A complete mole is a type of molar pregnancy that occurs when there is an abnormal fertilization of the egg by the sperm, resulting in a mass of cells that do not have the normal features of a developing embryo. This can be misdiagnosed as a threatened abortion, choriocarcinoma, or ectopic pregnancy, but a complete mole is a distinct entity with its own set of characteristics.\n\n", "output3": "Paial mole, also known as complete mole, is a rare condition in which a fertilized egg develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. It is often confused with ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus, but in this case, it is not a fertilized egg. Ectopic pregnancy is a more common condition and is often misdiagnosed as a threatened abortion or a complete mole.\n\n"}, {"question": "The following statements about the rehabilitation of the medical team, what's wrong?", "correct_answer": "Each professional is to work independently, treatment outcome is not affected mutual", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Each has its own full-time professionals an important role", "B)Each professional is to treat the patient's successful work for the common goal", "C)The main person responsible for the patient's overall medical team are physicians", "D)Each professional is to work independently, treatment outcome is not affected mutual"], "prompt": "The following statements about the rehabilitation of the medical team, what's wrong?A)Each has its own full-time professionals an important role\nB)Each professional is to treat the patient's successful work for the common goal\nC)The main person responsible for the patient's overall medical team are physicians\nD)Each professional is to work independently, treatment outcome is not affected mutual", "subject_name": null, "output0": "The correct answer is A)Each has its own full-time professionals an important role.
