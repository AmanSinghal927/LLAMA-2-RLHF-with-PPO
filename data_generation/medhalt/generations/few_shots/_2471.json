In this case, the patient's blood group is unknown, so it is recommended to use blood products that are compatible with all blood groups (Group 0). Both packed red blood cells (CH) and fresh frozen plasma (PFC) are compatible with all blood groups, so the best option is to use CH of group 0 positive and PFC 0 positive.
