This type of genetic change can lead to the production of a chimeric protein that inhibits the activation of CD95. Therefore, cells with this genetic change would be expected to have decreased activation of CD95.\n\n", "output1": "Cells with the genetic change of joined chromosomes 14 and 18 would likely have decreased activity of p53, a tumor suppressor protein. This is because the joined chromosomes can lead to a loss of function of the p53 protein, which can contribute to the development of cancer.\n\n", "output2": "The genetic change described, where part of chromosomes 14 and 18 are joined together, is known as a t(14;18) translocation. This translocation is associated with a variety of hematological malignancies, including follicular lymphoma. One of the characteristic features of this translocation is the decreased release of cytochrome c, which is a key component of the apoptotic pathway. As a result, cells with this genetic change are less likely to undergo programmed cell death, leading to the development of malignancy.\n\n", "output3": "The genetic change described, where part of chromosomes 14 and 18 are joined together, is associated with a condition called chromosomal translocation. This condition can lead to the overexpression of the Apaf-1 protein, which is a pro-apoptotic protein that plays a role in the regulation of cell death. Therefore, cells with this genetic change are likely to have increased activation of Apaf-1.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 38-year-old G4P3 presents to her obstetrician\u2019s office for her 20-week anatomy ultrasound.
