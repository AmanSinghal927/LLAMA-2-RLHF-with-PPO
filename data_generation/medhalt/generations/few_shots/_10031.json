This is because spironolactone, the medication that was recently added to the patient's regimen, is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which can cause hyperkalemia. Calcium gluconate is a calcium salt that can help to counteract the effects of hyperkalemia by shifting potassium from the intracellular space to the extracellular space.
