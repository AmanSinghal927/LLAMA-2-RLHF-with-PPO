This is because fever can cause the body to produce more adrenaline, which can slow down the heart rate.\n\n", "output1": "The presence of bradycardia in Augustine could be linked to the presence of hemorrhage. Bradycardia is a common symptom of blood loss, as the body responds to the loss of blood volume by slowing down the heart rate.\n\n", "output2": "Digitalis, a medication commonly used to treat heart conditions, can cause bradycardia as a side effect. Therefore, it is likely that Augustine's bradycardia is related to the digitalis medication he is taking.\n\n", "output3": "When a patient, like Augustine, goes from a decubitus position to standing, it can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, leading to bradycardia. This is a common cause of bradycardia in older adults, especially those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.\n\n"}, {"question": "Non-motile bacterium is -", "correct_answer": "Clostridium perfringens", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Vibrio", "B)Clostridium septicum", "C)Clostridium perfringens", "D)Legionella"], "prompt": "Non-motile bacterium is -A)Vibrio\nB)Clostridium septicum\nC)Clostridium perfringens\nD)Legionella", "subject_name": "Microbiology", "output0": "Non-motile bacteria are bacteria that do not have the ability to move or swim.
