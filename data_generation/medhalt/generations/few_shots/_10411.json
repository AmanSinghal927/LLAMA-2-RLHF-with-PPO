Anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells or a lower than normal amount of hemoglobin in the blood. This can lead to a decrease in the amount of oxygen being delivered to the body\u2019s tissues, which can cause fatigue, headaches, and shortness of breath. The patient\u2019s history of Crohn\u2019s disease and current use of methotrexate may also contribute to the development of anemia.
