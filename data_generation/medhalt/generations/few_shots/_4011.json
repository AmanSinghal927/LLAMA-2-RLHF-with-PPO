This is because the zygomatic bone is most stable in this area, and the fracture is more likely to be reduced successfully.\n\n", "output2": "The Zygomatico-maxillary buttress region is the area where the zygomatic bone and the maxilla meet, and it is a critical area for check point reduction in ZMC fractures.\n\n", "output3": "The symmetry of the arch is an important checkpoint for ZMC fracture reduction. This is because the zygomatic bone is a critical structure that helps to maintain the symmetry of the arch. If the zygomatic bone is not properly aligned, it can lead to an asymmetrical arch, which can cause problems with chewing and speaking.\n\n"}, {"question": "11 yr female in the school brought to principle by teacher that she is always crying unattentive not taking interest in any activity.
