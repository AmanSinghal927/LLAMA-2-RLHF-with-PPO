This is because negative emotions can have a negative impact on the immune system and overall well-being.\n\n", "output1": "Research has shown that people who passively accept their cancer diagnosis tend to have a poorer prognosis compared to those who actively cope with the diagnosis. This is because passive acceptance is associated with a lack of emotional support and a decrease in the use of coping strategies.\n\n", "output2": "Research has shown that people who are able to express their negative emotions in a healthy manner have better chances of survival. This is because they are able to release their emotions in a productive way, rather than bottling them up and allowing them to negatively impact their physical and mental health.\n\n", "output3": "Research has shown that individuals who are more independent and responsible tend to have better outcomes in terms of survival and quality of life. This is because these individuals are more likely to take an active role in their own care, adhere to treatment plans, and make healthy lifestyle choices.\n\n"}, {"question": "Disturbed nasal breathers have tongue position in?", "correct_answer": "Downward but retracted", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Downwardbut protracted", "B)Downward but retracted", "C)Upward and touching palate", "D)Upward and protracted"], "prompt": "Disturbed nasal breathers have tongue position in?A)Downwardbut protracted\nB)Downward but retracted\nC)Upward and touching palate\nD)Upward and protracted", "subject_name": "Dental", "output0": "Disturbed nasal breathers have a tongue position that is downward but protracted, meaning that the tongue is positioned in a way that obstructs the airflow through the nose.\n\n", "output1": "Disturbed nasal breathers have a tongue position that is downward but retracted.
