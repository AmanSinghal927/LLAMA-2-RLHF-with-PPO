This is because the proximal segment is the furthest from the point of entry of the blood supply, and therefore may experience the most severe ischemia and necrosis.\n\n", "output1": "The distal segment of a scaphoid fracture is more susceptible to avascular necrosis due to its anatomical location. The distal segment is further away from the main blood supply of the bone, which can lead to a decrease in blood flow and an increase in the risk of avascular necrosis.\n\n", "output2": "The scaphoid bone is the most susceptible to avascular necrosis in the middle segment, which is the area that is most prone to ischemia due to the retrograde blood supply.\n\n", "output3": "The scaphoid tubercle is the most susceptible to avascular necrosis due to its anatomical location and blood supply. It is located in the distal pole of the scaphoid bone, which is the furthest point from the main blood supply. Additionally, the scaphoid tubercle has a relatively poor blood supply compared to other parts of the scaphoid bone.
