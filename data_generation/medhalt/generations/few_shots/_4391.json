This action can help to regulate the excitability of neurons and improve the symptoms of ADHD.\n\n", "output1": "Nicorandil is an I(' channel opener, which means it increases the activity of the I(' channel in the brain. This channel is responsible for the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons. By increasing the activity of the I(' channel, nicorandil can increase the release of neurotransmitters and improve the activity of the nervous system.\n\n", "output2": "Nicorandil is a selective blocker of sodium channels, specifically the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC). This blockade of sodium channels reduces the influx of sodium ions into the cell, which in turn leads to a decrease in the depolarization of the cell membrane and a decrease in the excitability of the neuron.\n\n", "output3": "Nicorandil is a potassium channel blocker that is used to treat conditions such as hypertension and angina. It works by blocking the influx of potassium ions into the cell, which can help to reduce the amount of potassium in the blood and lower blood pressure.\n\n"}, {"question": "Valvular lesion most often resulting from myocardial infarction is:", "correct_answer": "Mitral regurgitation", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Aortic stenosis", "B)Mitral stenosis", "C)Mitral regurgitation", "D)Pulmonary stenosis"], "prompt": "Valvular lesion most often resulting from myocardial infarction is:A)Aortic stenosis\nB)Mitral stenosis\nC)Mitral regurgitation\nD)Pulmonary stenosis", "subject_name": "Medicine", "output0": "Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular lesion resulting from myocardial infarction, as it is often caused by scarring of the aortic valve leaflets due to the prolonged increased pressure on the valve during a heart attack.\n\n", "output1": "Mitral stenosis is a valvular lesion most often resulting from myocardial infarction because it is the most common valvular complication of myocardial infarction.
