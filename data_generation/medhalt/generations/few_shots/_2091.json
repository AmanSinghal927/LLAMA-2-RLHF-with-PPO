UV light can damage the cell membrane of bacteria and viruses, which can lead to their death. Lipids are particularly susceptible to UV damage because they are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, which are easily damaged by UV light.\n\n", "output1": "Carbohydrates are a type of biomolecule that can absorb UV radiation and increase the sensitivity of bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation.\n\n", "output2": "Inorganic salts, such as zinc sulfate and silver sulfadiazine, can sensitize bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation by damaging their cell membranes and DNA, making them more susceptible to UV light.\n\n", "output3": "Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are more susceptible to the effects of UV irradiation than other biomolecules. This is because UV light can cause the formation of mutagenic and carcinogenic lesions in DNA and RNA, which can lead to the death of bacteria and viruses.\n\n"}, {"question": "Syndrome which is characterized by 2X chromosomes and 1Y chromosome is:", "correct_answer": "Kleinfelter syndrome", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Kleinfelter syndrome", "B)Down syndrome", "C)Turner syndrome", "D)Marfan syndrome"], "prompt": "Syndrome which is characterized by 2X chromosomes and 1Y chromosome is:A)Kleinfelter syndrome\nB)Down syndrome\nC)Turner syndrome\nD)Marfan syndrome", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "Kleinfelter syndrome is a rare genetic condition in which individuals have 2 X chromosomes and 1 Y chromosome.

This is because the coagulation cascade is activated and there is excessive consumption of clotting factors, leading to a shortened clotting time.\n\n", "output1": "Increased aPTT is the most sensitive laboratory test for revealing bleeding in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). This is because aPTT measures the intrinsic factor, which is affected by the amount of clotting factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. In DIC, the consumption of clotting factors leads to a prolongation of the aPTT, which can be detected earlier than other tests such as PT or fibrinogen levels.\n\n", "output2": "Decreased fibrinogen is a laboratory finding that is commonly seen in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). This is because DIC causes widespread consumption of clotting factors, including fibrinogen.\n\n", "output3": "Increased FDPs (fibrinogen degradation products) are the most sensitive indicator of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) activity. DIC is a disorder in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body.
