This genetic disorder is caused by an increase in the number of glutamic acid repeats in the beta-globin gene, which leads to a defective hemoglobin protein. This defective protein can cause red blood cells to become sickle-shaped, leading to anemia and other symptoms.\n\n", "output1": "The Tay-Sachs disease is caused by an expansion of three nucleotide repeats in the HEXA gene, which codes for the enzyme hexosaminidase A. This expansion leads to a deficiency of this enzyme, which is essential for the breakdown of certain fats in the body. As a result, there is a build-up of these fats in the brain and other tissues, leading to the symptoms of the disease.\n\n", "output2": "The expansion of three nucleotide repeats is the cause of Huntington's disease. This is a genetic disorder that causes progressive damage to the brain, leading to a decline in cognitive, motor, and psychiatric functions. The expansion of the repeat sequence in the Huntingtin gene is the cause of this disease.\n\n", "output3": "The expansion of three nucleotide repeats is the cause of scurvy, a disease that affects the body's ability to produce vitamin C. This is the correct answer because scurvy is caused by an expansion of three nucleotide repeats in the gene that codes for the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase, which is necessary for the production of vitamin C.\n\n"}, {"question": "Fibrosis associated with liver cirrhosis is mediated by -", "correct_answer": "PDGF", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)PDGF", "B)IFN-y", "C)ICAM-1", "D)PcAM-l"], "prompt": "Fibrosis associated with liver cirrhosis is mediated by -A)PDGF\nB)IFN-y\nC)ICAM-1\nD)PcAM-l", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "Fibrosis associated with liver cirrhosis is mediated by PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), which is a protein that promotes the proliferation of fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix.\n\n", "output1": "Fibrosis associated with liver cirrhosis is mediated by IFN-y.
