Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is that the value of the quantum number of angular momentum varies between zero and infinity. This is because the hydrogen atom is a quantum mechanical system, and the quantum number of angular momentum is a measure of the amount of angular momentum of the electron in the atom.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)The hydrogen wave functions depend on four quantum numbers, among which, the main quantum number takes values \u200b\u200bbetween one and infinity.

Shigella is a bacterium that causes acute diarrheal illness, often with abdominal cramps, fever, and vomiting. The symptoms began after eating an in-flight meal, which is consistent with foodborne illness. The fact that the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is allergic to shellfish may also contribute to the development of Shigella infection.

This means that the sodium amide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the chlorine atom in chlorobenzene, leading to the formation of aniline.\n\n", "output2": "The mechanism by which the reaction of chlorobenzene with sodium amide in liquid ammonia proceeds to give rise to aniline, after hydrolysis, is an addition-removal reaction. The sodium amide acts as a nucleophile and adds to the chlorobenzene, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond. This is followed by the removal of the leaving group, which is the chlorine atom. The resulting product is aniline.\n\n", "output3": "The mechanism by which the reaction of chlorobenzene with sodium amide in liquid ammonia proceeds to give rise to aniline, after hydrolysis, is an elimination-addition reaction. This is because the sodium amide acts as a base to deprotonate the benzene ring, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes an elimination reaction to form aniline.\n\n"}, {"question": "Pain which goes through direct channels from skin receptors to pain centers in brain is component of:", "correct_answer": "Specificity theory", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Peripheral pattern theory", "B)Central summation", "C)Specificity theory", "D)Pattern theory"], "prompt": "Pain which goes through direct channels from skin receptors to pain centers in brain is component of:A)Peripheral pattern theory\nB)Central summation\nC)Specificity theory\nD)Pattern theory", "subject_name": "Pathology", "output0": "Peripheral pattern theory is a component of the Turtle Technique that involves stimulating specific areas of the body, such as the skin, to help children regulate their emotions and behaviors.
