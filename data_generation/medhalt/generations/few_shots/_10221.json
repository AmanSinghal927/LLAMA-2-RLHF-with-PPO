This linkage is essential for the stability and continuity of the chain.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is B)The nitrogenous bases bind to the pentose molecule for its carbon 1 '. This is because the nitrogenous bases, such as adenine and guanine, are attached to the pentose molecule through a nitrogenous base pair. The nitrogenous base pairs are formed by hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases and the carbon 1 'of the pentose molecule.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)The pentose can be glucose or fructose. The pentose is a five-carbon sugar that makes up the backbone of a nucleic acid chain.

It is the step at which the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase is the most limiting, and it is the step at which the TCA cycle is most sensitive to changes in substrate availability.\n\n", "output1": "The TCA cycle has several rate-limiting steps, but the most significant one is the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. This step is slow because it requires the enzyme citrate synthase, which is not as abundant as other enzymes in the cycle. This bottleneck can limit the overall rate of the TCA cycle.\n\n", "output2": "The rate-limiting step in the TCA cycle is the conversion of succinyl CoA to succinate. This step is slower than the other steps in the cycle, as it requires the enzyme succinate thiokinase, which is present in limited amounts.\n\n", "output3": "The succinate-fumarate step is the rate-limiting step in the TCA cycle. This is because the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, succinate dehydrogenase, has a high Km for succinate and a low Vmax, which means that it has a low affinity for succinate and a low turnover number. This results in a slow rate of conversion of succinate to fumarate.\n\n"}, {"question": "What DNA virus has palindromic sequences at its ends to facilitate its replication by the host DNA polymerase ?:", "correct_answer": "Parvovirus.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Polyomavirus", "B)Papillomavirus.", "C)Parvovirus.", "D)Baculovirus."], "prompt": "What DNA virus has palindromic sequences at its ends to facilitate its replication by the host DNA polymerase ?:A)Polyomavirus\nB)Papillomavirus.\nC)Parvovirus.\nD)Baculovirus.", "subject_name": "biology", "output0": "Polyomavirus has palindromic sequences at its ends, which facilitates its replication by the host DNA polymerase.\n\n", "output1": "Papillomavirus has palindromic sequences at its ends, which allows it to replicate by using the host DNA polymerase.
