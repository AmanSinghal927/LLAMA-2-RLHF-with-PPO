This makes it a good choice for applications where a high degree of flexibility is required, such as in medical devices or other precision instruments.\n\n", "output1": "Wires made of Cr-Co-Ni alloy are more flexible and can be bent for a maximum number of times before they fracture compared to other materials. This is because the alloy has a higher ductility and can withstand more stress without breaking.\n\n", "output2": "Ni-Ti wires are the most flexible and can be bent the maximum number of times before fracture. This is because they have a high elastic limit and can withstand repeated bending without breaking.\n\n", "output3": "Beta-titanium is a type of wire that is known for its high flexibility and resistance to fracture. It can be bent and twisted to a maximum number of times without breaking, making it a good choice for a variety of applications.\n\n"}, {"question": "When treating a primary alcohol with HBr, the corresponding haloalkane is normally obtained by SN2 reaction through:", "correct_answer": "Ion alkoxonium.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Ion alkoxonium.", "B)Radical alkyloxonium.", "C)Alkyloxonium anion.", "D)Alkyl anion."], "prompt": "When treating a primary alcohol with HBr, the corresponding haloalkane is normally obtained by SN2 reaction through:A)Ion alkoxonium.\nB)Radical alkyloxonium.\nC)Alkyloxonium anion.\nD)Alkyl anion.", "subject_name": "chemistry", "output0": "When treating a primary alcohol with HBr, the reaction proceeds through an SN2 mechanism, which involves the formation of an alkoxonium ion. This ion then reacts with a base, such as sodium hydroxide, to form the corresponding haloalkane. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n", "output1": "The corresponding haloalkane is obtained by SN2 reaction through a radical alkyloxonium ion. This is because the haloalkane is a more stable product than the alkoxonium ion, which can undergo a radical reaction to form the haloalkane.\n\n", "output2": "The SN2 reaction involves the attack of the nucleophile (in this case, the alkoxonium ion) on the carbon atom of the alkyl halide, resulting in the formation of a new C-O bond. This reaction proceeds through the formation of a tertiary alkoxide ion, which is then reduced to the corresponding alkyl alcohol. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Alkyloxonium anion.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Alkyl anion. This is because the reaction of a primary alcohol with HBr is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, which involves the attack of the nucleophile (HBr) on the alcohol molecule. The resulting alkyl anion can then be neutralized with a base to form the corresponding haloalkane.\n\n"}, {"question": "Rideal-walker coefficient for disinfectant used for cholera stool should be ?", "correct_answer": "10", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)2", "B)4", "C)7", "D)10"], "prompt": "Rideal-walker coefficient for disinfectant used for cholera stool should be ?A)2\nB)4\nC)7\nD)10", "subject_name": "Social & Preventive Medicine", "output0": "The Riddel-Walker coefficient for disinfectant used for cholera stool should be 2 because cholera stool is highly contagious and can spread the disease easily.

At this stage, the pancreas starts to produce insulin, which is essential for the development of the fetus and the regulation of blood sugar levels.\n\n", "output1": "Insulin production in the fetus begins around 12 weeks of gestation. This is a critical time in fetal development, as the pancreas is developing and preparing to produce insulin to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n", "output2": "Insulin production in the fetus begins around 14-18 weeks of gestation. The pancreas starts to produce insulin in response to the growing demands of the fetus for glucose.\n\n", "output3": "Insulin production in the fetus begins around 24-28 weeks of gestation.
