The splicing reaction requires the presence of a guanosine nucleoside or guanosine nucleotide at the 5' splice site of the intron.\n\n", "output1": "During splicing, the need for ligase arises because it is responsible for joining the two halves of the RNA molecule together. Ligase is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA molecule, which is essential for the formation of the mature RNA molecule.\n\n", "output2": "The splicing of the first intron (group I intron) is a type of splicing that requires the presence of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and the enzyme ligase. These molecules work together to remove the intron from the pre-mRNA, allowing the mRNA to be processed and translated into protein.\n\n", "output3": "During the splicing process, ATP, NAD +, and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are required to facilitate the reactions that remove the intron from the pre-mRNA. The small nuclear RNAs act as a guide to help the splicing machinery recognize the intron-exon boundaries, and the ATP and NAD + provide the energy and cofactors needed to perform the splicing reactions.\n\n"}, {"question": "Francisco is a child affected by phenylketonuria, an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.

In this case, the parents have a 50% chance of having a child affected by the disease, regardless of the sex of the children.\n\n", "output3": "This is because phenylketonuria is a recessive disease, which means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.
