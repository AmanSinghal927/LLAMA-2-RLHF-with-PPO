It involves the patient being exposed to situations that trigger the urge to pull their hair, while simultaneously being prevented from doing so. This can help the patient to learn to control their urges and reduce the frequency of their hair pulling.\n\n", "output2": "The reversal of habit is a technique that is more indicated in the treatment of trichotillomania.
