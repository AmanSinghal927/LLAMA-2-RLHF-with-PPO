The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta in the fetus, allowing blood to bypass the lungs and receive oxygen directly from the mother's blood. After birth, the ductus arteriosus typically closes within a few hours, but in this case, it has not closed yet. As a result, blood is not able to bypass the lungs, and the infant's tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, leading to cyanosis.\n\n", "output2": "The most likely cause of cyanosis in this newborn is the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+.

The inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP is a pulmonary vasodilator, and it is known to cause allosteric alteration of heme groups, leading to a decrease in the amount of oxygen-binding sites available for hemoglobin.
