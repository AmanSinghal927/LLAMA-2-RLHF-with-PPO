In cervical incompetence, the diameter of the internal os is typically less than 1 cm, which can make it difficult for the baby to pass through and can lead to preterm birth.\n\n", "output1": "The internal os of the cervix is the opening of the cervix that allows the passage of the sperm. In cervical incompetence, the diameter of the internal os is typically between 1.5 cm and 2 cm. This range is considered normal and is not considered a sign of incompetence.\n\n", "output2": "The internal os of the cervix in cervical incompetence is typically 2 cm in diameter. This is because the cervix is not fully dilated, and the internal os is still relatively small.\n\n", "output3": "The internal os of the cervix is the opening of the cervix that is used to measure the diameter of the cervical canal. In cervical incompetence, the diameter of the internal os is typically greater than 2.5 cm. This is because the cervix is not able to properly support the pregnancy and the internal os is stretched, which can lead to preterm labor and other complications.\n\n"}, {"question": "The phases of the nurse-patient relationship are the following: Orientation Phase, Identification Phase, Exploitation Phase and Resolution Phase.
