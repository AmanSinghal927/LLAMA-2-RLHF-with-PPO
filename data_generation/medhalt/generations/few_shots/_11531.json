Angiotensin II is a hormone that constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure. By decreasing Angiotensin II levels, the Turtle Technique helps to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure.\n\n", "output2": "The Turtle Technique aims to decrease cardiovascular activity by slowing down the heart rate and blood pressure. This is achieved by breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization. By decreasing cardiovascular activity, the technique can help children to relax and reduce stress.\n\n", "output3": "When the body experiences a decrease in arterial pressure, the kidneys release more aldosterone to help regulate the blood pressure. This is a normal response to help maintain the body's homeostasis.\n\n"}, {"question": "26 a 29-year-old woman, G1P0, 38 weeks of pregnancy, hospitalized because of the pain to be produced.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the normal duration of the second stage of labor (when the cervix is dilating) is approximately 1-2 hours.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the cervix typically dilates at a rate of 1 to 1.5 centimeters per hour during the active phase of labor. If the cervix stops dilating for more than 1.5 hours, it is considered a secondary arrest of dilatation, also known as \"time dilation onset stop.\"\n\n", "output3": "According to the information provided, the hysteresis phenomenon in the birth process can cause a delay in the expansion of the cervix, resulting in a longer time between the onset of contractions and the start of dilatation. This delay is known as \"time dilation onset Stop\" (secondary arrest of dilatation). In this case, the cervix stopped expanding for more than 2 hours, which is considered a long time and may indicate a secondary arrest of dilatation.\n\n"}, {"question": "The greater selectivity of bromination with respect to the chlorination of alkanes can be explained by recourse to:", "correct_answer": "Postulate of Hammond.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Concerted character of the reaction.", "B)Postulate of Hammond.", "C)Thermo-neutral character of the determined stage of the bromination speed.", "D)Ionic nature of the stage that determines the kinetics of the reaction."], "prompt": "The greater selectivity of bromination with respect to the chlorination of alkanes can be explained by recourse to:A)Concerted character of the reaction.\nB)Postulate of Hammond.\nC)Thermo-neutral character of the determined stage of the bromination speed.\nD)Ionic nature of the stage that determines the kinetics of the reaction.", "subject_name": "chemistry", "output0": "The greater selectivity of bromination with respect to chlorination can be attributed to the concerted character of the reaction. In the case of bromination, the halogen atom is introduced in a single step, which involves the coordination of the halogen with the metal center. This concerted mechanism allows for a higher degree of control over the reaction and results in a higher level of selectivity for the bromination reaction.\n\n", "output1": "The greater selectivity of bromination with respect to chlorination can be explained by the Postulate of Hammond, which states that the rate of a reaction is determined by the thermodynamics of the system. In the case of bromination, the reaction is more thermodynamically favorable, resulting in a higher selectivity for bromination over chlorination.\n\n", "output2": "The greater selectivity of bromination with respect to chlorination can be explained by the thermo-neutral character of the determined stage of the bromination speed. This means that the reaction is not significantly affected by changes in temperature, allowing for a more selective reaction.\n\n", "output3": "The greater selectivity of bromination with respect to chlorination can be attributed to the ionic nature of the bromination reaction.
