On examination, he had xanthoma. Blood sample was taken for work-up blood sample had milky appearance of plasma. Which of the following lipoprotein is increased?A)LDL\nB)HDL\nC)Chylomicron\nD)Chylomicron remnants", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "output0": "The presence of xanthoma in the child with severe abdominal pain and milky appearance of plasma suggests that there is an increase in chylomicron remnants. Chylomicron remnants are the residual chylomicrons that are not absorbed in the peripheral tissues and are carried back to the liver via the bloodstream. The increased level of chylomicron remnants in the blood can cause the plasma to appear milky. Additionally, the increase in chylomicron remnants can also lead to the increase in LDL cholesterol, which is the main component of chylomicrons. Therefore, the correct answer is A) LDL.\n\n", "output1": "Increased levels of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) are associated with xanthoma, which is a condition characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the skin. The milky appearance of the plasma in the blood sample is indicative of high levels of chylomicrons, which are the largest and most buoyant lipoprotein particles in the blood.\n\n", "output2": "Chylomicron remnants are increased in the presence of xanthoma, which is a condition characterized by the accumulation of lipids in the tissues. The milky appearance of the plasma in the blood sample is due to the presence of chylomicrons, which are large, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are produced in the intestines and transported to the tissues.\n\n", "output3": "In cases of xanthoma, the level of chylomicron remnants is typically increased. Chylomicron remnants are a type of lipoprotein that is formed when chylomicrons, which are large, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, are broken down. The presence of xanthoma suggests that there is an abnormal accumulation of chylomicron remnants in the tissue, which can lead to the formation of xanthomas.\n\n"}, {"question": "Detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by?", "correct_answer": "Binding of ATP", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Entry of calcium into sarcoplasmic reticulum", "B)Change in troponin C configuration", "C)Binding of ATP", "D)Release of ADP and Pi"], "prompt": "Detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by?A)Entry of calcium into sarcoplasmic reticulum\nB)Change in troponin C configuration\nC)Binding of ATP\nD)Release of ADP and Pi", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "When calcium ions enter the sarcoplasmic reticulum, they bind to troponin C and cause a conformational change that leads to the detachment of myosin heads from actin filaments. This is an important step in the regulation of muscle contraction.\n\n", "output1": "When a muscle is stimulated to contract, the troponin C molecule undergoes a conformational change that allows the myosin head to detach from actin. This change in troponin C configuration is essential for muscle contraction.\n\n", "output2": "When ATP binds to myosin, it causes a conformational change in the myosin head that results in the detachment of the myosin head from actin.\n\n", "output3": "When the muscle contracts, ADP and Pi are released from the myosin head, which causes the myosin head to detach from the actin filament.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 55-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of an increasing sensation of fullness in the upper left side of his abdomen.
