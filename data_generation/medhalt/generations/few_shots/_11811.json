This can affect the centric occlusion of the denture, which is the way the upper and lower teeth fit together when the denture is in place. By rebasing the denture, the dentist can improve the fit and function of the denture, which can improve the patient's chewing ability and overall satisfaction with their denture.\n\n", "output1": "When rebasing a denture, the dentist changes the relationship between the denture base and the surrounding tissues, which are in centric relation. The goal is to create a more comfortable and stable fit for the denture.\n\n", "output2": "When rebasing a denture, the entire denture base is changed, including the tissue surface. This is in contrast to relining, which only changes the tissue surface.\n\n", "output3": "When rebasing a denture, the tissue surface is altered to provide a better fit and more comfortable wear for the patient. This involves reshaping the denture base to conform to changes in the patient's tissue, such as bone resorption or soft tissue changes. In contrast, relining involves only the denture surface, and does not affect the tissue surface.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 19-year-old female college soccer player presents to a sports medicine clinic with right knee pain.
