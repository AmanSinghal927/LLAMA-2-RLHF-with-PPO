This is because the condensation process becomes more efficient and the material becomes more rigid, which reduces the amount of deformation that occurs under load.\n\n", "output1": "Creep rate decreases with a decrease in the force of condensation. When the force of condensation is too high, the turtle's shell becomes too hard and less flexible, which can lead to a decrease in the creep rate.\n\n", "output2": "When the creep rate of a material decreases, it means that the material is becoming less malleable and more brittle. This can occur when the material is either under-triturated (too little force) or over-triturated (too much force). In both cases, the material is not subjected to the optimal amount of stress, leading to a decrease in its plasticity and an increase in its brittleness.\n\n", "output3": "Creep rate decreases with delay in time between trituration and condensation because the longer the delay, the more time the water has to seep into the turtle's shell and weaken it. This makes the turtle more susceptible to cracking and breaking.\n\n"}, {"question": "RET proto-oncogene is associated with the development of", "correct_answer": "Medullary carcinoma thyroid", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)Medullary carcinoma thyroid", "B)Astrocytoma", "C)Paraganglioma", "D)Huhle cell tumor thyroid"], "prompt": "RET proto-oncogene is associated with the development ofA)Medullary carcinoma thyroid\nB)Astrocytoma\nC)Paraganglioma\nD)Huhle cell tumor thyroid", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "The RET proto-oncogene is a gene that is associated with the development of medullary carcinoma thyroid, a type of thyroid cancer.
