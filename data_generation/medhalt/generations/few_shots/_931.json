The increased glycogen in the liver seen on liver biopsy also supports this diagnosis. Glucose-6-phosphatase is the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose, and its deficiency would lead to a build-up of glycogen in the liver and other tissues, as seen in this child.\n\n", "output1": "The clinical presentation of low blood glucose, ketoacidosis, and increased lactate levels in this child suggests a defect in glucose metabolism. The fact that intravenous glucagon raises blood glucose levels but does not raise glucose when given after an overnight fast suggests that the defect is in the liver. The liver is responsible for glycogen storage and glucose release. Muscle phosphorylase is responsible for breaking down glycogen in the muscles. Therefore, the enzyme likely to be defective in this child is muscle phosphorylase.\n\n", "output2": "The branching enzyme is responsible for the branching of glycogen molecules in the liver. The child's liver biopsy shows increased glycogen in the liver, which is indicative of a defect in the branching enzyme. Additionally, the child's low blood glucose levels and the presence of ketoacidosis suggest that the child is unable to properly metabolize glucose, which is consistent with a defect in the branching enzyme.\n\n", "output3": "The clinical features of this child, such as chronic liver failure, muscle weakness, and low serum glucose, are consistent with a defect in the glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD0). GSD0 is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme debranching enzyme, which is necessary for the breakdown of glycogen. The increased glycogen in the liver seen on biopsy is a hallmark of this condition. The normal levels of blood lactate and uric acid also support this diagnosis.\n\n"}, {"question": "Indicate which of these toxins is responsible for the serious poisoning caused by Amanita phalloides:", "correct_answer": "Amanitin", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Falolysin", "B)Falotoxin", "C)Amanitin", "D)Muscarina."], "prompt": "Indicate which of these toxins is responsible for the serious poisoning caused by Amanita phalloides:A)Falolysin\nB)Falotoxin\nC)Amanitin\nD)Muscarina.", "subject_name": "pharmacology", "output0": "Falolysin is a toxin found in the mushroom Amanita phalloides, and it is responsible for the serious poisoning caused by this mushroom.
