Additionally, patients with CKD stage 4 may have decreased insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the dose of insulin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper glucose control.\n\n", "output1": "In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, the dose adjustment of insulin required is typically a decrease in the dose. This is because the kidneys are not able to effectively remove excess insulin from the body, leading to increased risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of insulin is necessary to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.\n\n", "output2": "For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 and on insulin, the dose of insulin is usually not adjusted. The goal is to maintain the patient's blood glucose levels within the target range. However, the patient's insulin dose may need to be monitored and adjusted periodically based on changes in their kidney function and other factors.\n\n", "output3": "In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the dose adjustment of insulin required is to add DPP-4 inhibitors. This is because DPP-4 inhibitors can increase the bioavailability of insulin, which can help to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n"}, {"question": "Where are glucocorticoids synthesized ?:", "correct_answer": "In the fasciculated and reticular areas of the adrenal cortex.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)In the anterior pituitary.", "B)In the adrenal medulla.", "C)In the fasciculated and reticular areas of the adrenal cortex.", "D)On the islets of Langerhans."], "prompt": "Where are glucocorticoids synthesized ?:A)In the anterior pituitary.\nB)In the adrenal medulla.\nC)In the fasciculated and reticular areas of the adrenal cortex.\nD)On the islets of Langerhans.", "subject_name": "psychology", "output0": "Glucocorticoids are synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland.
