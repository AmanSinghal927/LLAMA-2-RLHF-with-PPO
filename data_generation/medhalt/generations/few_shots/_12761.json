This is because it contracts to reduce the volume of the sound waves that reach the inner ear. This helps to protect the inner ear from potential damage caused by loud noises.\n\n", "output1": "The tensor tympani muscle is responsible for tensioning the tympanic membrane, which helps to dampen very loud sounds and protect the inner ear from potential damage.\n\n", "output2": "The tensor tympani muscle is a small muscle located in the middle ear. It functions to tense the pharyngotympanic tube, which is a tube that connects the back of the throat to the middle ear. This helps to dampen very loud sounds and prevent noise trauma to the inner ear.\n\n", "output3": "The tensor tympani muscle helps to dampen very loud sounds and prevent noise trauma to the inner ear. When the sound is too loud, the muscle contracts and reduces the pressure on the tympanic membrane, which helps to protect the inner ear from damage.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following increases paicle diffusion across the cell membrane ?", "correct_answer": "Increasing lipid solubility of substance", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Increasing size of paicle", "B)Decreasing lipid solubility of substance", "C)Increasing lipid solubility of substance", "D)Decreasing size of opening in cell membrane"], "prompt": "Which of the following increases paicle diffusion across the cell membrane ?A)Increasing size of paicle\nB)Decreasing lipid solubility of substance\nC)Increasing lipid solubility of substance\nD)Decreasing size of opening in cell membrane", "subject_name": "Physiology", "output0": "Increasing the size of the particle increases the rate of diffusion across the cell membrane, as larger particles have a greater surface area and are more likely to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane.\n\n", "output1": "Decreasing the lipid solubility of a substance increases its diffusion across the cell membrane. This is because the substance is more likely to dissolve in the aqueous phase of the membrane, rather than in the lipid phase. As a result, the substance can diffuse more easily across the membrane.\n\n", "output2": "Increasing the lipid solubility of a substance increases the diffusion of the substance across the cell membrane, as lipids are more soluble in the cell membrane than in water. This increases the concentration gradient of the substance, which drives the diffusion process.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Decreasing size of opening in cell membrane. When the opening in the cell membrane is smaller, it allows for more precise control over the movement of substances into and out of the cell. This increases the diffusion of particles across the cell membrane, as there is less space for particles to diffuse through.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of a swollen, tender left knee for the past 4 days.
