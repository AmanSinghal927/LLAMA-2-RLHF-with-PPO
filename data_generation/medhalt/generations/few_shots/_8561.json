This is because these individuals have already undergone ovarian ablation, which can increase their risk of developing endometrial cancer.\n\n", "output1": "Women who have ovarian dysgenesis (also known as ovarian agenesis) are at a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. This is because the ovaries do not produce estrogen and progesterone, which are hormones that help regulate the growth of the uterus. Without these hormones, the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) can become overgrown and develop into cancer.\n\n", "output2": "Because the risk of developing endometrial cancer is higher in women who have had multiple full-term pregnancies, especially if they started menstruating at an early age or went through menopause at an older age.\n\n", "output3": "Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer due to their hormonal imbalance and the presence of insulin resistance. This condition is more common in women who are over the age of 35, which is why women in this age group are more likely to develop endometrial cancer.\n\n"}, {"question": "Best guide for the management of Resuscitation is:", "correct_answer": "Urine output", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)CVP", "B)Urine output", "C)Blood pressure", "D)Saturation of Oxygen"], "prompt": "Best guide for the management of Resuscitation is:A)CVP\nB)Urine output\nC)Blood pressure\nD)Saturation of Oxygen", "subject_name": "Surgery", "output0": "The best guide for the management of Resuscitation is CVP (Central Venous Pressure) because it is a more accurate indicator of cardiac output and systemic perfusion than other parameters such as blood pressure or urine output.\n\n", "output1": "Urine output is the best guide for the management of Resuscitation because it provides a clear and objective measure of the effectiveness of resuscitation efforts.
