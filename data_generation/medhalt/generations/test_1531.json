D)The trait appears more frequently in women.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because in an autosomal recessive trait, the individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to express the trait. Since the parents are carriers, they will have one copy of the mutated gene and one copy of the normal gene, so they will not express the trait. However, they can pass on either the mutated or the normal copy of the gene to their offspring, who will inherit two copies of the gene if they inherit one copy from each parent. Therefore, the trait will appear more frequently in the offspring.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because affected individuals are not capable of transmitting the trait to their offspring.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because in each generation, the chance of a carrier of the trait passing it on to their offspring is zero, but the chance of a non-carrier passing it on is 100%.
