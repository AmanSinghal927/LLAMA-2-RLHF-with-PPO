D)All phase changes that a substance can undergo by modifying the pressure and temperature to which it is subjected are spontaneous and occur with an increase in entropy.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot> A: Because at low temperatures the molecules have less kinetic energy and therefore are more likely to be in a state of disorder, which is reflected in an increase in entropy.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the entropy variation of an isolated system during a transformation is a measure of the disorder of the system, and a positive entropy variation indicates a spontaneous transformation, while a negative entropy variation indicates a non-spontaneous transformation.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because, by definition, an increase in entropy implies a spontaneous transformation. When a closed system experiences an increase in entropy, it means that the system has undergone a transformation from a more ordered state to a more disordered state, which is a spontaneous process.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the change in entropy is a measure of the amount of thermal energy that is unavailable to do work in the system.
