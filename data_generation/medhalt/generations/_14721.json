When acetylcholine is released, it binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane, causing muscle contraction. By blocking the release of acetylcholine, Botox inhibits muscle contraction.\n<human>: Ah, I see. So Botox is essentially a reversible neuromuscular blocker?\n<bot>: Yes, that's correct. Botox is a reversible neuromuscular blocker, which means that it temporarily blocks the transmission of nerve signals to the muscle, but it does not permanently damage the nerve or muscle. The effects of Botox typically last for a few months before the body starts to break it down and the muscle function returns to normal.", "output3": "\n<bot>: Botox (botulinum toxin) injections work by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the nerve endings, which in turn causes muscle contraction.

By blocking the release of acetylcholine, the muscle cells are unable to contract, leading to a reduction in muscle spasms.
