These abnormal prion proteins form fibrillar deposits in the interstitium, which are the hallmark of the disease. The fibrillar deposits are composed of abnormal prion protein fibrils that are resistant to degradation and are found throughout the brain, including the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. The accumulation of these fibrillar deposits in the interstitium leads to the destruction of brain tissue and the characteristic vacuolization of the neuropil.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) caused by an abnormal isoform of a protein called prion.
