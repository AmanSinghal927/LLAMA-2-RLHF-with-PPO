The other options do not form a chemical bond with enamel.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: BIS-GMA resins in pit and fissure sealants form chemical bonds with enamel through a process called hydrolysis. This process involves the breakdown of the BIS-GMA resin by water, resulting in the formation of free radicals that react with the enamel surface to form a strong chemical bond.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Direct filling resins form a chemical bond with enamel through the hydroxyapatite crystals in the tooth structure.

The fact that the girl was sleeping in an old family house in the countryside, which may have a higher likelihood of having insect infestations, also supports this diagnosis.
