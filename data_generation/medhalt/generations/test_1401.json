It is mediated by the tubular cells in the kidney, which respond to changes in the concentration of sodium in the glomerular filtrate. When the concentration of sodium in the filtrate is high, the tubular cells secrete less sodium into the urine, and when the concentration is low, they secrete more sodium. This helps to maintain a stable concentration of sodium in the blood.
