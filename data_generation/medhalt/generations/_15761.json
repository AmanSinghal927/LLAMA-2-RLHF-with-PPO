Given the patient's recent symptoms of shortness of breath, wheezing, and a productive cough, the addition of rofilumast to his treatment regimen would be beneficial in improving his lung function and symptoms.

Therefore, adding both tiotropium and fluticasone to the treatment regimen would be appropriate to help improve lung function and reduce symptoms.
