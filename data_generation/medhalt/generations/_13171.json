However, the patient's symptoms have been present for only 8 hours, and the pain has not worsened over time. Additionally, the patient's blood work shows a normal white blood cell count and a negative C-reactive protein, which suggests that the inflammation is not severe.

Additionally, the patient's history of a previous episode of similar symptoms that resolved on its own suggests that she may have a recurrent or chronic condition.
