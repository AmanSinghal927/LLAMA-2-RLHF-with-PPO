This enzyme is responsible for the glucuronidation of bilirubin, a process that is necessary for the excretion of bilirubin from the liver. In Dubin-Johnson syndrome, the mutation in the UGT1A1 gene leads to a deficiency of functional glucuronyltransferase enzyme, resulting in an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood and liver, leading to jaundice.
