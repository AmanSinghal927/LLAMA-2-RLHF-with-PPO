The body responds by increasing the respiratory rate and depth to try to take in more oxygen. However, this can lead to respiratory acidosis, which is an excess of hydrogen ions in the blood, as the body tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: When you ascend to high altitude, the air pressure is lower and there is less oxygen available. The body responds by increasing the rate and depth of breathing to try to take in more oxygen. This is known as hyperventilation.

The format of the treatment can impact the patient's resistance to the treatment, as some patients may find certain formats more or less engaging or acceptable.
