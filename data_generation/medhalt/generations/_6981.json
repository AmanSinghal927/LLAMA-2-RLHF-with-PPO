In the case of 3T3 cells, the NRU test is used to assess the effects of various compounds on the cells' ability to retain the dye. Since carcinogens can damage cellular membranes and disrupt cellular function, a decrease in NRU values can indicate the presence of a carcinogen.

Mutagenesis is the process of altering the genetic material of an organism, which can lead to changes in the cell's membrane structure and function.
