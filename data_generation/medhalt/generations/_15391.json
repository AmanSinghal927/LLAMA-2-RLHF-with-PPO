Therefore, the intensity of the stimulus has a greater effect on the intensity of the sensation than the number of stimuli.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The Weber-Fechner law states that the just-noticeable difference (JND) in the intensity of a stimulus is proportional to the logarithm of the change in the stimulus.

Therefore, the Weber-Fechner law is related to the number of stimuli, not the intensity of a single stimulus.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The Weber-Fechner law states that the magnitude of a sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the intensity of the stimulus.
