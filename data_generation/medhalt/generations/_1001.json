The presence of macroscopic involvement of the sentinel lymph node and the absence of involvement of the rest of isolated axillary lymph nodes (pN1) also indicate a high risk of nodal involvement.

Additionally, the tumor is estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive, which is a good prognostic factor. Therefore, the most appropriate adjuvant systemic treatment would be adjuvant chemotherapy in association with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, which has been shown to improve survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

Additionally, the tumor is positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, which suggests that hormone therapy may be effective in treating the cancer. However, the patient also has macroscopic involvement of the sentinel lymph node, which indicates that the cancer has already spread to the lymphatic system. Therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary to treat the cancer and reduce the risk of recurrence. The use of anthracyclines and taxanes in adjuvant chemotherapy is supported by the evidence, as they have been shown to improve survival and reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer. After completing adjuvant chemotherapy, hormone therapy can be considered to further reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 43-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of progressive muscle pain and stiffness that worsens with exercise.
