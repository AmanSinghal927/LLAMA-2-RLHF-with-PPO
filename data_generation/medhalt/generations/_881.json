Additionally, epinephrine can also increase cholesterol catabolism, which is the breakdown of cholesterol into fatty acids and bile salts. Therefore, the correct answer is B)All of the above.", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Because epinephrine increases the breakdown of cholesterol and fatty acids in the body, leading to an increase in free fatty acid levels.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Epinephrine stimulates the breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids, which are then released into the bloodstream.

After 6 days, half of the T3 in the body will have been broken down and eliminated.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The half-life of T3 is the time it takes for the concentration of T3 in the body to decrease by half. Since T3 is a thyroid hormone, it is rapidly metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine. The half-life of T3 is about 10 hours, which means that the concentration of T3 in the body decreases by half every 10 hours.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The half-life of T3 is 1 day because T3 is converted to T4 in the liver, which is then converted to reverse T3.
