One of the factors is the age of the individual. Studies have shown that adults are more likely to experience phantom pain than children. This is because the neural pathways that are responsible for the sensation of pain are more developed in adults, making it more likely for them to experience pain in the absence of a limb. Additionally, adults may have more experience with pain and may be more likely to attribute pain to the phantom limb. Children, on the other hand, may be more likely to ignore or dismiss the pain, or they may not have the same level of awareness of the pain.\n\n"}, {"question": "Child presents with hypotonia and seizures.
