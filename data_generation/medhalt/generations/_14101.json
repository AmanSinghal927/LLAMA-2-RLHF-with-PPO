B)It is inversely proportional to the intensity of the force. C)It exhibits the same properties of physical spaces. D)It is directly proportional to the intensity of the force.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: In Kurt Lewin's Field Theory, the psychological distance between two points is seen as a single route or path that an individual can take to move from one point to the other. This means that there is only one way to achieve a goal, and that is by following the shortest path between the two points.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the psychological distance is a measure of the difficulty or the energy required to move from one state to another. The more energy or effort required, the greater the psychological distance. Therefore, the intensity of the force is inversely proportional to the psychological distance.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because, in Kurt Lewin's Field Theory, psychological distance is a metaphorical space that exhibits similar properties to physical space, such as the ability to move in different directions, the existence of barriers and obstacles, and the concept of proximity and distance.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the psychological distance is directly related to the intensity of the force required to move from one state to another. The more intense the force, the shorter the distance between the states.\n<human>"}, {"question": "Loading dose MgSO4 (IV) to be prepared as", "correct_answer": "16 ml 50% w/v plus 4 ml NS", "options": ["A)12 ml 50% w/v plus 8 ml NS", "B)8 ml 50% w/v plus 12 ml NS", "C)16 ml 50% w/v plus 4 ml NS", "D)4 ml 50% w/v plus 16 ml NS"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Loading dose MgSO4 (IV) to be prepared asA)12 ml 50% w/v plus 8 ml NS B)8 ml 50% w/v plus 12 ml NS C)16 ml 50% w/v plus 4 ml NS D)4 ml 50% w/v plus 16 ml NS\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because 12 ml of 50% MgSO4 solution is equal to 6 g of MgSO4, and 8 ml of NS is equal to 8 g of sodium chloride.
