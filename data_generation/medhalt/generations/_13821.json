This suggests that she has high levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies in her blood. These antibodies can cross the placenta and be transferred to the fetus, causing thyroid dysfunction and poor weight gain in the newborn.\n<human>: That makes sense. What is the significance of the swelling of the neck?\n<bot>: The swelling of the neck is a sign of thyroiditis, which is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. This is a common complication of Graves' disease and can be caused by the transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies.\n<human>: So, what should be done to manage this condition?\n<bot>: The newborn should be referred to a pediatric endocrinologist for further evaluation and management. The pediatric endocrinologist may perform tests such as thyroid function tests and antibody tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.
