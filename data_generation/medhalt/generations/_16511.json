The absence of dystrophin protein is a hallmark of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. The other options are not typically associated with muscular dystrophy.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Because the patient has marked enlargement of both calves, which is a characteristic feature of arylsulfatase A deficiency, also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VII. This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce certain enzymes needed to break down sugar molecules. The patient's delayed walking and falls are also consistent with this diagnosis. The other options are not likely to be associated with this condition.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: The patient's history of delayed walking and the fact that he uses his hands to push himself up into a standing position suggest a neuromuscular disorder. The enlargement of the calf muscles is consistent with a condition that affects the nervous system, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by a deficiency of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) protein.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The patient's symptoms of delayed walking and the enlargement of the calf muscles are consistent with a diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), which is a rare genetic disorder caused by a loss of function mutation in the ATM gene. The patient's history of falling multiple times in the last year is also consistent with the motor coordination problems that are characteristic of AT.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following compounds that increase the nasal absorption of drugs acts increasing the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa ?:", "correct_answer": "Sodium glycolate", "options": ["A)Sodium glycolate", "B)Histamine.", "C)Methylcellulose", "D)EDTA"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following compounds that increase the nasal absorption of drugs acts increasing the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa ?:A)Sodium glycolate B)Histamine. C)Methylcellulose D)EDTA\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Sodium glycolate increases the time of permanence in the nasal mucosa by increasing the viscosity of the mucus, making it more difficult for the drug to be cleared from the nasal cavity. This results in a longer residence time of the drug in the nasal mucosa, allowing for more effective absorption.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Histamine increases the permeability of the nasal mucosa, allowing the drug to be absorbed more easily and remain in the nasal mucosa for a longer period of time.\n\n", "output3": "\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: EDTA is a chelating agent that binds to divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium in the nasal mucosa, increasing the residence time of the drug in the nasal mucosa.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements is true in relation to the different phases of clinical trials ?:", "correct_answer": "Bioequivalence studies are a special type of phase III trial.", "options": ["A)Phase IV clinical trials are exploratory efficacy.", "B)Bioequivalence studies are a special type of phase III trial.", "C)Phase I clinical trials are performed on a very large number of patients.", "D)The search for doses is one of the main objectives of phase II clinical trials."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following statements is true in relation to the different phases of clinical trials ?:A)Phase IV clinical trials are exploratory efficacy.

These trials are considered exploratory because they are designed to gather additional information about the drug's effectiveness and safety in these populations, rather than to establish its overall efficacy and safety.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: That's correct because bioequivalence studies are a type of phase III clinical trial that is specifically designed to compare the bioavailability and bioequivalence of two different formulations of the same drug. These studies are typically conducted after the drug has been approved for marketing and are designed to ensure that the drug is safe and effective in different formulations.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because phase I clinical trials are conducted on a small number of healthy volunteers, typically less than 100, to assess the safety and tolerability of a new drug or treatment.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Phase II clinical trials are designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a new drug or treatment, and to determine the optimal dose or dosing regimen for further study.\n<human>"}, {"question": "Following intracoronal bleaching immediate composite restoration required, what has to be done:", "correct_answer": "Not possible", "options": ["A)Wait for 7 days is mandatory", "B)Treat with H2O2 for 3 minutes", "C)Treat with catalase", "D)Not possible"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Following intracoronal bleaching immediate composite restoration required, what has to be done:A)Wait for 7 days is mandatory B)Treat with H2O2 for 3 minutes C)Treat with catalase D)Not possible\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because intracoronal bleaching can cause a severe inflammatory response and the use of composite restorations within 7 days of bleaching can lead to a higher risk of failure.

To ensure the safety of the patient and the effectiveness of the bleaching, it is mandatory to wait for 7 days before performing composite restoration. This allows the hydrogen peroxide to dissipate from the tooth and surrounding tissues, reducing the risk of adverse effects.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because catalase can help to remove the residual hydrogen peroxide from the dentin, which can cause irritation or inflammation if left untreated. Treating with catalase immediately after intracoronal bleaching can help to minimize these risks and ensure a successful restoration.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because immediate composite restoration is not possible after intracoronal bleaching.

The kidney does not require glucose for its energy needs. Instead, the kidney uses lactate, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, as its main source of energy. Therefore, there is no need for glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme in the kidney.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The liver is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by breaking down glucose and storing it in the form of glycogen. The absence of glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme in the liver would prevent the liver from breaking down glucose and storing it as glycogen, leading to an accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase is absent in the brain because it is not necessary for the brain's metabolic needs.
