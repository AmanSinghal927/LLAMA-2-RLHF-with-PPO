This is because pulmonic stenosis is a condition in which the pulmonary valve is narrowed or obstructed, causing an increase in pressure within the right ventricle and backflow of blood into the left atrium, leading to the dilatation and hypertrophy of the left atrium and ventricle.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The structural changes in the heart, such as dilatation of the left atrium and expansion of the left ventricular cavity with associated eccentric hypertrophy, are consistent with chronic hypertension. This is because chronic hypertension can cause the heart to become enlarged and thickened, leading to dilatation of the chambers and eccentric hypertrophy of the muscle fibers.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The structural changes described in the patient's heart, including dilatation of the left atrium and expansion of the left ventricular cavity with associated eccentric hypertrophy, are consistent with mitral insufficiency. Mitral insufficiency is a condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left atrium and causing the heart to work harder to pump blood. The eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle is a common compensatory response to mitral insufficiency.\n\n"}, {"question": "Marker of endoplasmic reticulum?", "correct_answer": "LDH", "options": ["A)Acid phosphatase", "B)Catalase", "C)LDH", "D)Glucose-6-phosphatase"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Marker of endoplasmic reticulum?A)Acid phosphatase B)Catalase C)LDH D)Glucose-6-phosphatase\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Acid phosphatase is a marker of endoplasmic reticulum because it is an enzyme that is specifically localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and is used to degrade phosphate groups in proteins and lipids.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Catalase is a marker of endoplasmic reticulum because it is present in the ER and its activity is used as an indicator of ER function.\n\n", "output3": "A)LDH is a marker of endoplasmic reticulum\n\n", "output4": "A)It is an enzyme that hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and inorganic phosphate.\n\n"}, {"question": "Wahin finkeldey cells are seen in", "correct_answer": "Rubella", "options": ["A)Rubella", "B)Measles", "C)Rabies", "D)Typhoid"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Wahin finkeldey cells are seen inA)Rubella B)Measles C)Rabies D)Typhoid\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because Wahlin-Finkeldey cells are large, binucleate cells that are found in the lymph nodes of patients with rubella (German measles).

Mammography may not be as useful in this case because it is primarily used to detect breast cancer, and the lump may not be large enough to be detected on mammography.

The thyroid gland is sensitive to radiation and can develop nodules or cancer. Therefore, the first step is to check the levels of T3 and T4 hormones, which are produced by the thyroid gland, to see if there is any abnormality.
