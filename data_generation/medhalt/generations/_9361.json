This is often seen in cases of eye injuries, such as those caused by fingertips or other blunt objects. The other options, such as friction abrasion, imprint abrasion, and contusion, can also cause eye injuries, but they are less likely to result in a patterned abrasion.\n\n"}, {"question": "What do we mean by the Health System ?:", "correct_answer": "Set of hospitals and health centers that make up the public health network.", "options": ["A)Joint public and private institutions directly involved in health care.", "B)Public structural model that covers the health needs of the population.", "C)Set of hospitals and health centers that make up the public health network.", "D)Set of establishments and health professionals responsible for the healing of individuals."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:What do we mean by the Health System ?:A)Joint public and private institutions directly involved in health care.
