Using the imagined exposure instead of the live exposure (C) may also lead to a decrease in effectiveness as it may not provide the same level of anxiety reduction as live exposure. Associating exposure therapy with benzodiazepines (D) is not a recommended practice as it may interfere with the learning process and increase the risk of dependence on the medication.
