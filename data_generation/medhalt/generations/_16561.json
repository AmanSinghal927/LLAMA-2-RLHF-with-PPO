Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, and it is caused by a expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene. Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Other relevant genetic disorders include myotonic dystrophy, which is caused by a CTG or CCTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, and spinocerebellar ataxia, which is caused by a CAG or CGG repeat expansion in the SCA genes.\n\n", "output2": "\n\n", "output3": "\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because triple nucleotide repeats are the most common type of nucleic acid repeat that can cause genetic disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease.\n\n"}, {"question": "The depth of clinical gingival sulcus is the distance between the gingival margin to the", "correct_answer": "Cementoenamel Junction", "options": ["A)Apical penetration of the probe", "B)Apical extension of junctional epithelium", "C)Alveolar crest", "D)Cementoenamel Junction"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:The depth of clinical gingival sulcus is the distance between the gingival margin to theA)Apical penetration of the probe B)Apical extension of junctional epithelium C)Alveolar crest D)Cementoenamel Junction\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The depth of the clinical gingival sulcus is the distance between the gingival margin and the apical penetration of the probe, because the probe is inserted into the sulcus to measure the depth.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The apical extension of junctional epithelium is the depth of the clinical gingival sulcus because it is the distance between the gingival margin and the apical extension of the junctional epithelium.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The depth of clinical gingival sulcus is the distance between the gingival margin and the alveolar crest.
