This can lead to premature ejaculation if the man is not able to control his sexual urges.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: During the excitement phase, the penis becomes erect and the man experiences a strong desire to ejaculate. This desire is often too strong to control, leading to premature ejaculation.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: During the resolution phase, the body begins to return to its pre-aroused state. This can include the release of hormones such as oxytocin and prolactin, which can help to reduce sexual desire and make it more difficult to achieve orgasm. Premature ejaculation is often characterized by a sudden and rapid release of semen, which can occur before or during the resolution phase.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Premature ejaculation occurs when the male orgasm occurs too quickly, before the male has had enough time to enjoy the sexual experience or before the female has had enough time to reach orgasm. This typically happens during the orgasmic phase of the sexual cycle, which is the phase where the male experiences the peak of sexual pleasure and releases semen.\n\n"}, {"question": "What muscle has its origin in the zygomatic arch and its insertion in the external surface of the mandible ?:", "correct_answer": "Temporary.", "options": ["A)Masetero.", "B)Temporary.", "C)Bucinador.", "D)Biggest Zygomatic"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:What muscle has its origin in the zygomatic arch and its insertion in the external surface of the mandible ?:A)Masetero.
