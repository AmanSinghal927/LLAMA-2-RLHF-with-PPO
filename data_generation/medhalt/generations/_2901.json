So, the increased capillary pressure caused by venular dilatation can cause fluid to leak out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, leading to edema.

Venous pressure drop can even lead to decreased venous return and cardiac output. Venular dilatation (option B) is not a common cause of edema either.
