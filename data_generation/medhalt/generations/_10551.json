The force of the impact can cause the bone to break and the fragments to be displaced, often causing the biceps tendon to become detached from the bone. The biceps tendon is located on the front of the elbow and is responsible for flexing the elbow joint. When the biceps tendon is detached, the biceps muscle is unable to contract, which can lead to elbow stiffness and limited mobility.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because olecranon fractures are most commonly caused by direct blows to the elbow, such as a fall onto an outstretched hand, rather than by elbow flexion.
