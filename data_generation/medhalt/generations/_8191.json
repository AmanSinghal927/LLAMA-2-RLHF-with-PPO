The patient's symptoms of decreased urinary output, malaise, and mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet are consistent with EGPA. The patient's history of recent coronary intervention and the presence of eosinophils in the blood and kidney biopsy are also supportive of EGPA. Polyarteritis nodosa and cholesterol embolization are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms, as they are more commonly associated with systemic inflammation and do not account for the patient's eosinophilia.

The patient's history of recent coronary intervention and the presence of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles on renal biopsy support this diagnosis. Cholesterol embolization is a known complication of coronary intervention and can cause renal damage, leading to decreased urinary output and malaise.
