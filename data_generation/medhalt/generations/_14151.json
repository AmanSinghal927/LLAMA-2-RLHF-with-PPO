Onlays are restorations that are placed on teeth that have been weakened by decay or trauma, and they are designed to strengthen the tooth and prevent further damage. If the tooth is painful or sensitive after an onlay has been placed, it is likely due to an underlying issue such as pulpitis or a crack in the tooth, which can be detected during a dental examination.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Infra occlusion can cause pain and sensitivity in a tooth with an onlay due to the pressure of the occlusion forces on the tooth structure, which can lead to microleakage and irritation of the pulp.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Gingivitis is a common cause of pain and sensitivity in teeth with restorations, especially if the restoration is new.
