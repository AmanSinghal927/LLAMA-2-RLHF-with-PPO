This increase in calcium triggers the release of glucose from storage sites in the cardiac cells, which increases the energy available to the heart.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Nicorandil blocks the influx of Cl- ions into cardiac muscle cells, which reduces the amount of Cl- ions available for the production of ATP. This leads to a decrease in the amount of ATP produced by the heart, which can help to reduce the workload on the heart and reduce the risk of angina.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Nicorandil is a potassium channel blocker, specifically a selective blocker of the IK channel. By blocking these channels, nicorandil increases the duration of the action potential and the heart rate.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Nicorandil is a potassium channel opener that increases the conductance of potassium ions through the membrane.
