Gastrulation and fertilization are earlier stages in the development of the embryo, and ovulation is the release of the egg from the ovary.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because fertilization is the process by which the sperm and egg cells unite to form a zygote, which then develops into an embryo. The three germ layers are formed during the early stages of embryonic development, and fertilization is the first step in that process.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Ovulation is the process by which the egg is released from the ovary and fertilized by the sperm.

A delta fibers are responsible for the transmission of sensory information, and are not present in striated muscle. Unmyelinated fibers are also present in striated muscle, but they are not responsible for the transmission of motor neuron signals.
