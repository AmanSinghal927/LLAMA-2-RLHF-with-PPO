The patient's symptoms of muscle pain and weakness during exercise suggest that there may be a defect in this enzyme, leading to impaired glycogen breakdown and reduced muscle energy production.

Since the patient is experiencing muscle pain and weakness, especially during strenuous workouts, it is possible that there is a defect in the enzyme that is responsible for breaking down glucose-6-phosphate. This would lead to an accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate in the muscles, which could cause the muscle pain and weakness that the patient is experiencing.
