B)The enzyme is not modified, but loses its catalytic activity. C)The enzyme is denatured to facilitate binding to the substrate. D)The enzyme is not modified and can be reused.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because enzymes are proteins, and proteins can't perform chemical reactions on their own. They need cofactors to bind to the active site of the enzyme and facilitate the reaction.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: When an enzyme catalyzes a reaction, it binds to the substrate and undergoes a conformational change to facilitate the reaction. This conformational change is reversible, and the enzyme can release the product and revert to its original conformation. However, if the enzyme is denatured, it loses its native conformation and cannot revert to its original state, leading to a loss of catalytic activity. Therefore, the correct answer is B)The enzyme is not modified, but loses its catalytic activity.", "output3": "\n<bot>: When an enzyme catalyzes a reaction, it binds to the substrate and undergoes a conformational change to form an enzyme-substrate complex. This conformational change, or denaturation, exposes the active site of the enzyme to the substrate, allowing the reaction to proceed.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: That's because enzymes are highly specific biological molecules that can catalyze specific reactions, and once the reaction is complete, the enzyme can be reused without being denatured or modified.\n\n"}, {"question": "Drug binds to activate the receptor in same fashion, which directly or indirectly brings effect, is:", "correct_answer": "Inverse agonist", "options": ["A)Partial agonist", "B)Inverse agonist", "C)Antagonist", "D)Agonist"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Drug binds to activate the receptor in same fashion, which directly or indirectly brings effect, is:A)Partial agonist B)Inverse agonist C)Antagonist D)Agonist\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: A partial agonist is a ligand that binds to a receptor and activates it, but not to the same extent as a full agonist. It can either activate the receptor partially or have a weaker effect compared to a full agonist.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: An inverse agonist is a ligand that binds to a receptor and prevents the action of an agonist, while producing no effect on the receptor itself. In other words, it blocks the action of an agonist, but does not activate the receptor.\n<human>", "output3": "\n<bot>: An antagonist is a molecule that binds to a receptor and prevents the binding of an agonist, thereby preventing the activation of the receptor. In the case of the drug, it binds to the receptor and prevents the activation of the receptor, which is the opposite of an agonist. Therefore, the drug is an antagonist.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because a drug that binds to activate the receptor in the same fashion as the endogenous ligand is called an agonist.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 23 years old boy, a badminton player, sustained injury of left ankle.
