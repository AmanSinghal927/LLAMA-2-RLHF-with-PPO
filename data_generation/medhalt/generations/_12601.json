Therefore, the correct answer is B)Heart rate (heart rate) lower.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: During aerobic exercise, the heart rate increases and cardiac output increases, leading to an increase in blood flow to the muscles. However, the oxygen demand of the muscles increases even more, leading to an increase in the arteriovenous oxygen difference, which is the difference between the oxygen content of the arterial blood and the oxygen content of the venous blood. This increase in arteriovenous oxygen difference is a physiological change that occurs during intense exercise.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: During intense exercise, the body's oxygen demand increases, and the heart rate increases to meet that demand. As a result, the cardiac output (cardiac output) increases, and the arteriovenous oxygen difference (arteriovenous O2 difference) increases. However, because the body's oxygen demand is so high, the blood vessels constrict to increase resistance and decrease blood flow to the muscles, leading to a decrease in systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure).\n\n"}, {"question": "Which Passive immunity is also provided through colostrum and breast milk?", "correct_answer": "IgM", "options": ["A)IgG", "B)IgE", "C)IgA", "D)IgM"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which Passive immunity is also provided through colostrum and breast milk?A)IgG B)IgE C)IgA D)IgM\n\nA:", "output1": "A)IgG is not present in colostrum and breast milk B)IgG is present in colostrum and breast milk but in small amounts C)IgG is present in colostrum and breast milk in large amounts D)IgG is present in colostrum and breast milk and provides long lasting immunity\n\n", "output2": "A)Because colostrum and breast milk contain high levels of IgE antibodies\nB)Because IgE is the only type of antibody that is not produced by the placenta\nC)Because IgE is the most common type of antibody found in colostrum and breast milk\nD)Because IgE is the most effective type of antibody at protecting against infection\n\n", "output3": "A)The IgA antibodies in colostrum and breast milk are not as effective as those in the bloodstream.B)The IgA antibodies in colostrum and breast milk are not as abundant as those in the bloodstream.C)The IgA antibodies in colostrum and breast milk are not as long-lasting as those in the bloodstream.D)The IgA antibodies in colostrum and breast milk are not as specific as those in the bloodstream.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Colostrum and breast milk contain high levels of IgM antibodies, which are transferred to the newborn through the placenta and breast milk, providing passive immunity against infections.\n\n"}, {"question": "The concentration of mercury will be higher:", "correct_answer": "In the centre", "options": ["A)At the margins", "B)In the centre", "C)Equally distributed", "D)None"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:The concentration of mercury will be higher:A)At the margins B)In the centre C)Equally distributed D)None\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the concentration of mercury is higher at the margins due to the centrifugal force.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because mercury is a dense metal, it will sink to the bottom of the container and accumulate in the centre.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because mercury is a liquid and will move freely in the container.\n<human>", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the concentration of mercury in a liquid is not affected by the distance from the center of the container.\n<human>"}, {"question": "77 patients in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder), the central nervous system stimulant often used (central stimulants), which of the following do not belong to these drugs?\n", "correct_answer": "Pemoline", "options": ["A)Pemoline", "B)Methylphenidate", "C)Dextroamphetamine", "D)Nortriptyline"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:77 patients in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder), the central nervous system stimulant often used (central stimulants), which of the following do not belong to these drugs?A)Pemoline B)Methylphenidate C)Dextroamphetamine D)Nortriptyline\n\nA:", "output1": "\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Methylphenidate is not a central stimulant, it is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.
