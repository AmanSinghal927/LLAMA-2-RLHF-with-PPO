Prolonged use of anastrozole can increase the risk of endometrial cancer, as estrogen is a protective factor against endometrial cancer.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> A: Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, which reduces the amount of estrogen in the body. Estrogen is a hormone that regulates cholesterol levels. With lower estrogen levels, the body produces more LDL cholesterol and less HDL cholesterol.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Anastrozole can cause a decrease in body weight, which can lead to excessive weight loss. This is because anastrozole works by blocking the production of estrogen, which can lead to a decrease in body fat.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Anastrozole can cause a decrease in bone mineral density, which can increase the risk for osteoporosis. This effect is more pronounced in postmenopausal women, who are more likely to develop osteoporosis due to hormonal changes.\n<human>"}, {"question": "Statements about Medvedev plexus (Meissner's plexus), and what's right?", "correct_answer": "Distributed in the muscle layer of the digestive tract", "options": ["A)In serosa common", "B)Similarly sympathetic stimulate sphincter function", "C)Distributed in the muscle layer of the digestive tract", "D)Regulating the secretion of glands and mucosa peristalsis"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Statements about Medvedev plexus (Meissner's plexus), and what's right?A)In serosa common B)Similarly sympathetic stimulate sphincter function C)Distributed in the muscle layer of the digestive tract D)Regulating the secretion of glands and mucosa peristalsis\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Meissner's plexus is a network of nerve fibers located in the serosa, a layer of connective tissue that covers the surface of the digestive tract.

Therefore, it is less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta, which are both highly selective barriers that prevent the passage of lipophilic substances.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because hyoscine butylbromide is a synthetic compound that is not metabolized by the liver and is not conjugated with glucuronic acid, which makes it less likely to be excluded from the brain and the placenta.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Glycopyrrolate bromide is a drug that selectively antagonizes the cholinergic receptors in the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, which causes a decrease in the secretion of gastric acid.

Corticosteroids have been shown to improve disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer. Additionally, corticosteroids can help to reduce the risk of developing heart complications, which are a common side effect of trastuzumab therapy.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Trastuzumab, also known as Herceptin, is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER-2/neu oncogene. Since the patient is positive for this gene, Trastuzumab can help to improve the patient's prognosis by inhibiting the growth and spread of cancer cells.
