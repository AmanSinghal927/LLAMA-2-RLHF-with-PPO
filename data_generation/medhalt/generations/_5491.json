Therefore, mitochondrial diseases that are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA are more likely to affect males, who inherit only one X-chromosome from their mother. Females, on the other hand, inherit one X-chromosome from their mother and one from their father, so they are less likely to be affected by these diseases.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule, it is not linear like nuclear DNA.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because mitochondrial DNA mutations can cause a variety of diseases, including optic neuropathy, and blindness, and these mutations are often inherited in a maternal pattern, meaning that the mother passes the mutated DNA to her children.

The mtDNA is inherited from the mother, as the mitochondria are passed down from the mother to the child. Since the mtDNA is passed down from the mother, the risk of inheriting a mitochondrial disease is higher in females, who have a higher number of mitochondria than males. Therefore, most mitochondrial diseases are autosomal recessive, meaning that the disease is caused by a mutation in both copies of the mtDNA, one inherited from each parent.\n\n"}, {"question": "'Potts puffy' tumour is:", "correct_answer": "A tumour or pituitary gland", "options": ["A)An extradural abscess", "B)A tumour or pituitary gland", "C)An adrenal gland tumour", "D)A malignant tumour"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:'Potts puffy' tumour is:A)An extradural abscess B)A tumour or pituitary gland C)An adrenal gland tumour D)A malignant tumour\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: An extradural abscess is a collection of pus outside the dura mater, which is the outermost membrane covering the brain and spinal cord.
