This condition is caused by a deficiency of surfactant, which is essential for normal lung function. The diffuse ground glass appearance on chest radiograph and the failure of surfactant replacement to improve gas exchange are both typical findings in nPAP. The negative results of routine cultures and echocardiography support this diagnosis. The history of a term female sibling who died of respiratory distress at 1 month of age also supports this diagnosis, as nPAP can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
