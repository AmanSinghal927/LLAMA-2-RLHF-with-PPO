However, if the refusal to go to school is due to a separation anxiety disorder, then the diagnosis of specific phobia should not be made.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The answer is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for specific phobia. According to the DSM-5, a specific phobia diagnosis is appropriate when the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent and lasts for at least 6 months. Additionally, the fear or avoidance must be excessive and interfere with daily life. In the case of school refusal, if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent and lasts for at least 6 months, and it interferes with the child's daily life, including their ability to attend school, then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be appropriate.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the diagnostic criteria for specific phobia require that the fear, anxiety, or avoidance be persistent and last for 6 months or more, and that it cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. In the case of school refusal, if the child's refusal to go to school is persistent and generates significant distress or impairment in social, academic, or family functioning, then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be warranted.
