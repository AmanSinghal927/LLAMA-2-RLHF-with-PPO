In the case of a contusion, the injury is caused by a blunt object and is characterized by a bruise or swelling, but there is no tear or cut in the skin. Puncture wounds are typically caused by a sharp object and result in a small, circular hole in the skin.

The injury is characterized by a small, circular or oval-shaped wound that is often shallow but can also be deep.
