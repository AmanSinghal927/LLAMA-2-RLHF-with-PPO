This suggests that the patient has mild asthma. For mild asthma, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a stepwise approach to treatment. The first step is to use inhaled steroids, which is the most effective treatment for mild asthma. However, if the patient's symptoms are not controlled with inhaled steroids alone, the next step is to add an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist, which is an add-on therapy. Therefore, the correct answer is C)Merger of inhaled steroids with oral leukotriene receptor antagonist junction (inhaled corticosteroid + oral leukotriene receptor antagonist)\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: The patient is a 10-year-old boy with asthma symptoms occurring less than once a month, and waking up coughing less than two times a week.

Inhaled steroids, long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, and the combination of inhaled steroids with oral leukotriene receptor antagonist may not be necessary for this patient, as they are typically reserved for more severe cases of asthma.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is one of the criteria for the inclusion of drugs in the selective financing of the National Health System ?:", "correct_answer": "Security.", "options": ["A)Effectiveness.", "B)Therapeutic and social value of the medicine.", "C)Low price.", "D)Security."], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following is one of the criteria for the inclusion of drugs in the selective financing of the National Health System ?:A)Effectiveness.
