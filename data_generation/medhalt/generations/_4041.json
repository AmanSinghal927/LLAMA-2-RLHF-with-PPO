By inhibiting the activity of the M2 protein, Tamiflu prevents the virus from spreading and achieves its viral suppression effect.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is a neuraminidase inhibitor, which means it blocks the activity of the neuraminidase enzyme that is essential for the release of the virus from infected cells. By inhibiting the activity of this enzyme, Tamiflu reduces the amount of virus that can be released into the body and helps to suppress the spread of the virus.\n\n", "output3": "A)Because M1 protein is the main target of oseltamivir\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: That's correct because Hemagglutinin (HA) is the protein on the surface of the influenza virus that recognizes and binds to the host cell receptor, sialic acid. Tamiflu (oseltamivir) works by inhibiting the release of the virus from the host cell, and it does this by blocking the activity of the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein.
