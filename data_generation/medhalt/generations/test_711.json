This is because respiratory alkalosis is caused by a primary metabolic disturbance, such as hypoventilation, which leads to an increase in blood pH and a decrease in arterial CO2 levels. The decrease in CO2 levels causes the body to compensate by increasing the production of bicarbonate, which can lead to a metabolic alkalosis.
