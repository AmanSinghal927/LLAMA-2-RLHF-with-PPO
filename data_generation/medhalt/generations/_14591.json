D)It does not have units.\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: Because the intrinsic viscosity is defined as the inverse of the relative viscosity, which is the ratio of the viscosity of a solution of the polymer to the viscosity of a solution of the solvent. Therefore, a higher intrinsic viscosity indicates a lower relative viscosity, and vice versa.\n<human>", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the intrinsic viscosity of a polymer in solution is a measure of the amount of entanglements between the polymer chains, and the molecular mass of the polymer affects the degree of entanglements.
