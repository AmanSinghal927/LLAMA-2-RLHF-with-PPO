Rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin are necessary to prevent the development of rabies in the patient.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because the patient is currently doing well and has a dog bite on his right distal forearm, which means that the wound is not severe enough to require sutures or closure.
