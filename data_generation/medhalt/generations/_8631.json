The SMN2 gene, located on chromosome 7, is a backup copy of the SMN1 gene and can compensate for the loss of SMN1. However, the SMN2 gene is not as efficient as the SMN1 gene, and the disease is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disease.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
