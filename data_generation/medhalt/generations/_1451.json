This results in a higher uptake of oxygen by the fetus.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot> : HbF has higher affinity for oxygen than HbA because of differences in their hemoglobin structure and therefore takes up oxygen more readily in the fetal circulation.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Because the uptake of 0 in fetal circulation is due to the immaturity of the placenta, which leads to a lower affinity of HbF for 0, and not due to any of the other factors you mentioned.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot> A: Because, Halden's effect refers to the preferential uptake of oxygen by the fetal circulation due to the higher affinity of hemoglobin F (HbF) for oxygen, compared to adult hemoglobin (HbA).
