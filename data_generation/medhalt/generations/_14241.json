The C1 complex is activated by the binding of antibodies to antigens, which triggers the cleavage of C2 to form C2a and C2b. C2b then binds to C4b and C2a binds to C4a, leading to the formation of C3 convertase. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.", "output2": "\n<bot>: The common pathway begins with the C5 component of the complement system, which is activated by the binding of antibodies to antigens on the surface of pathogens. This leads to the activation of the complement cascade, which ultimately results in the destruction of the pathogen.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The complement factor through which the common pathway begins is C3 because it is the first component of the complement system to bind to pathogens, marking them for destruction by the immune system.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Because the common pathway begins with the activation of protein B, which then activates C3 and C5, leading to the formation of the complement membrane attack complex.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following polysaccharides is a homopolysaccharide ?:", "correct_answer": "Hyaluronan", "options": ["A)Heparin.", "B)Hyaluronan", "C)Chitin", "D)Agarosa"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:Which of the following polysaccharides is a homopolysaccharide ?:A)Heparin.
