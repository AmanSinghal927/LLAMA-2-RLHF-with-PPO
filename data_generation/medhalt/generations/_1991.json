The other enterotoxins, such as VP3 and NSP4, can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but VP7 is the most common cause of diarrhea in children.\n<human>: Okay, that makes sense. What about NSP6?\n<bot>: NSP6 is an enterotoxin that is less abundant than VP7, but it can also cause diarrhea and vomiting, especially in children. However, NSP6 is more likely to cause bloody diarrhea than VP7.\n<human>: Thank you for the clarification.
