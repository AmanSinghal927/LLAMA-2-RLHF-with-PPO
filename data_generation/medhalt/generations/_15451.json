This is because xanthines increase the activity of the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), two important mediators of bronchodilation. By inhibiting the breakdown of cAMP and cGMP, xanthines increase the levels of these mediators, leading to bronchodilation. Coicosteroids, on the other hand, have an anti-inflammatory effect, which can help to reduce the inflammation in the airways that is causing the bronchospasm.
