Of these, optic nerve invasion is the most common mode of spread, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. This is because the optic nerve is a direct extension of the retina and is located close to the retinal tumor, making it a common route for the tumor to spread.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Retinoblastoma is a tumor that originates in the retina and can spread to the lymph nodes through the lymphatic system. Therefore, lymphatic invasion is the most common mode of spread of retinoblastoma.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the retina, and it typically spreads through the bloodstream (vascular system) to other parts of the body, such as the brain, bones, and liver. Therefore, the most common mode of spread of retinoblastoma is through the vascular system.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor that develops in the retina of children. The most common mode of spread of retinoblastoma is direct invasion, which occurs when the tumor grows and spreads into surrounding tissues, including the optic nerve, choroid, and sclera.
