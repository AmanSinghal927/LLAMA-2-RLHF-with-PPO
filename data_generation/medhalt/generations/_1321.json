It is known to play a role in the development and maintenance of the fetal membranes and the amniotic fluid. In cases of maternal infection, estriol levels can be elevated. In this case, the patient's lower back lesion and the need for surgical closure during infancy suggest that the mother may have had an infection during pregnancy, which could have led to elevated estriol levels.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Sphingomyelin is a sphingolipid that is found in the central nervous system and is involved in the development of the neural tube. Elevated levels of sphingomyelin in the maternal serum during pregnancy have been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, which is the most common congenital malformation affecting the central nervous system. In this patient's case, the lower back lesion and the subsequent paralysis from below the L2 nerve root are consistent with a spina bifida diagnosis.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot> A: Beta-human chorionic growth hormone (beta-hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. It is elevated in maternal serum when there is a risk of neural tube defects, which is a common finding in cases of spina bifida, the condition that the patient was born with. Elevated beta-hCG levels during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss, which may be related to the patient's history of multiple pregnancy losses.\n\n", "output4": "\n<bot>: Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetus that is elevated in maternal serum during pregnancy.
