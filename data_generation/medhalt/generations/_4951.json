The intradermal route allows the vaccine to be delivered directly to the skin, where it can be more easily taken up by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, and stimulate a stronger immune response.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: Because the live influenza vaccine is given by the subcutaneous route to avoid the risk of transmitting the virus to others through the respiratory tract.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: The live influenza vaccine is given intramuscularly because it needs to be injected into muscle tissue to be effective.
