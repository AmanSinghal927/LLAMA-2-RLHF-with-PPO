Additionally, the lower dorsal vertebrae are closer to the pelvis and the sacrum, which can make it more difficult to treat the infection.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The lumbar spine is the most common site of tuberculosis of the spine because it is the most kyphotic segment of the spine, which makes it more susceptible to the development of tuberculosis.

In contrast, the other options are not necessarily features of severe respiratory distress.

While cranberry juice may have some benefit in acidifying the urine, it is not a reliable method for preventing kidney stones.
