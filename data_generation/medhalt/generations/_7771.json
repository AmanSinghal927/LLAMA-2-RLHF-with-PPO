It is a normal phenomenon for infants at this age to still exhibit this reflex.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The absence of loss of the assymetric tonic neck reflex in a 9-month-old infant is a normal phenomenon. This reflex is typically present at birth and gradually disappears as the infant grows and develops.

In this case, the patient's mother was 35 years old at the time of delivery, which is considered advanced maternal age. Additionally, the patient's history of periventricular leukomalacia, which is a type of brain damage that can occur in premature infants, suggests that the patient may have been born prematurely.
