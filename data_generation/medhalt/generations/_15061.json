This is achieved by constricting blood vessels and increasing the resistance to blood flow. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: When the body is suddenly a lot of blood, the parasympathetic activity of the heart decreases, leading to an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. This is because the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the heart rate, is inhibited by the sudden increase in blood volume.\n\n", "output3": "\n<bot>: When the body experiences a sudden increase in blood loss, the arterial pressure decreases, activating the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. This activation leads to an increase in the discharge frequency of the baroreceptors, which in turn causes a reflexive increase in heart rate and cardiac output to maintain blood pressure. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n", "output4": "\n\n"}, {"question": "A health professional, not vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus (HBV), is accidentally punctured with a needle with blood from a patient with chronic infection with the virus.
