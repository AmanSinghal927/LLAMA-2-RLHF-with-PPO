This suggests that there is damage to the liver cells, which can lead to an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.

Decreased hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin (option A) and increased formation of bilirubin (option D) are less likely causes of jaundice in this patient, as there is no evidence of liver dysfunction or hemolysis.
