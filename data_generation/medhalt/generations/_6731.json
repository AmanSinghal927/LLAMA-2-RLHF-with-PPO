The AV node is responsible for transmitting the electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. When the impulses are conducted in an abnormal manner, it can result in an inverted P wave. The P wave is the electrical activity of the atria, and the inverted P wave indicates that the electrical activity of the atria is not normal.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The inverted P wave is generated in the Make of His, which is located in the ventricular septum.

This is because the atrioventricular node receives the electrical impulse from the sinus node, and then delays the impulse before transmitting it to the ventricles. This delay can cause the P wave to be inverted, meaning that the P wave is negative in the inferior leads and positive in the lateral leads. The QRS complex and the T wave are normal because they are not affected by the delay in the atrioventricular node.\n\n"}, {"question": "For an appeal against disciplinary action, final verdict is given by\u2013", "correct_answer": "State Government", "options": ["A)Central Government", "B)Central Medical Council", "C)State Medical Council", "D)State Government"], "prompt": "\n\nQ:For an appeal against disciplinary action, final verdict is given by\u2013A)Central Government B)Central Medical Council C)State Medical Council D)State Government\n\nA:", "output1": "\n<bot>: The final verdict on an appeal against disciplinary action is given by the Central Government because the Central Government has the power to make rules and regulations for the medical profession, and the Medical Council of India is a central government body.\n\n", "output2": "\n<bot>: The Central Medical Council is the highest authority for disciplinary action against doctors in India.
