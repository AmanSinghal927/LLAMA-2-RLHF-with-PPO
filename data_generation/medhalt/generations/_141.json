The basal ganglia receive inputs from sensory receptors and send outputs to the spinal cord and muscles. When a limb is suddenly stretched or injured, the basal ganglia are activated and send signals to the spinal cord to contract the antagonist muscle, which is the muscle that opposes the movement of the affected limb.
