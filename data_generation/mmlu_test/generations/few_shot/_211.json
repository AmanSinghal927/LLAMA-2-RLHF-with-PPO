The three factors that regulate stroke volume are blood volume, preload (the amount of stretch in the muscle fibers of the heart before each beat), and afterload (the resistance to blood flow in the circulatory system).\n\n", "output1": "Stroke volume is regulated by three factors: preload, contractility, and afterload. Preload refers to the amount of blood in the ventricles at the beginning of a contraction, contractility refers to the force of the heart muscle's contraction, and afterload refers to the resistance to blood flow in the circulatory system. These three factors work together to determine the amount of blood that is pumped out of the heart with each beat.\n\n", "output2": "The three factors that regulate stroke volume are contractility, blood volume, and blood pressure. Contractility refers to the heart muscle's ability to contract and pump blood effectively.

Together, these three factors work together to determine the amount of blood that is pumped with each heartbeat.\n\n", "output3": "The three factors that regulate stroke volume are cardiac output, contractility, and blood volume. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute, contractility is the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, and blood volume is the amount of blood in the circulatory system.
