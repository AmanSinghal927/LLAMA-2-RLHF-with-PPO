In this case, the bell produced a certain level of sound in decibels, and 20 mice pressed the lever when the power was set to 80%. This means that the absolute threshold for hearing the bell was 80% power.\n\n", "output1": "The correct answer is 70% because at this power level, the fewest number of mice pressed the lever, indicating that this was the threshold at which the mice could just barely hear the bell.\n\n", "output2": "The absolute threshold is the lowest intensity of a stimulus that can be detected by the human ear. At this level, the bell produces 60 decibels. Therefore, the answer is C)60%.\n\n", "output3": "The information provided does not give enough detail to determine the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell. The experiment only provides information on the number of mice that pressed the lever at different power levels, but it does not provide the actual decibel levels or the threshold for hearing the bell.
