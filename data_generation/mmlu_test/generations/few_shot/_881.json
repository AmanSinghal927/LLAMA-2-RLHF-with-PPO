This is because the small size of the litter is unusual for rodents, and it is likely that the males will be larger than the females.\n\n", "output1": "The characteristic of high parental investment is often associated with species that have small litter sizes, such as the rodents in this scenario. This is because the parents must invest more time and resources into each offspring to ensure their survival, as there are fewer offspring to spread the resources among.\n\n", "output2": "The characteristic of precocial young is most likely to be exhibited by small rodents that have a litter of two or three. Precocial young are those that are relatively mature and capable of independent survival at birth or soon after. In contrast, altricial young are helpless and require extensive care from their parents. Given the small litter size, it is likely that the rodents invest a lot of energy in each offspring, which is consistent with precocial young.\n\n", "output3": "The characteristic that is most likely to be exhibited by a species of small rodent that has a litter size of two or three is frequent extrapair matings. This is because small litter sizes are often the result of a trade-off between the mother's energy investment in raising her offspring and her energy investment in finding a high-quality mate. In this case, the mother may be investing more energy in finding multiple mates to increase her chances of producing offspring, rather than investing all of her energy in raising a large litter of offspring.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following sources makes the greatest contribution to the dry mass of organic matter that comprises an oak tree?", "correct_answer": "Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Organic molecules from decaying matter in the soil that are taken up by the roots", "B)Mineral nutrients dissolved in groundwater that are taken up by the roots", "C)Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air", "D)Endosperm located in the cotyledons of the acorn"], "prompt": "Which of the following sources makes the greatest contribution to the dry mass of organic matter that comprises an oak tree?A)Organic molecules from decaying matter in the soil that are taken up by the roots\nB)Mineral nutrients dissolved in groundwater that are taken up by the roots\nC)Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air\nD)Endosperm located in the cotyledons of the acorn", "subject_name": "college_biology", "output0": "The greatest contribution to the dry mass of an oak tree comes from organic molecules in the soil, as these molecules are taken up by the roots and used to synthesize the tree's biomass.\n\n", "output1": "Mineral nutrients dissolved in groundwater make the greatest contribution to the dry mass of organic matter that comprises an oak tree. This is because oak trees are often found in areas with poor soil quality, and the mineral nutrients in groundwater help to supplement the limited nutrients available in the soil.\n\n", "output2": "The greatest contribution to the dry mass of an oak tree comes from water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air. This is because the organic matter that comprises the tree is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which are all made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The source of these atoms is primarily from water and carbon dioxide.\n\n", "output3": "The endosperm is the nutrient-rich tissue that provides the energy and nutrients needed for the germination and early growth of an acorn.
