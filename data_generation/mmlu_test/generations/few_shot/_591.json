Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "correct_answer": "Aortic dissection", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)Acute myocardial infarction", "B)Aortic dissection", "C)Esophageal rupture", "D)Mitral valve prolapse"], "prompt": "A 47-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 2 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg.

The patient's history of smoking and hypertension also increase his risk for AMI.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and sweating, along with the presence of a diastolic blowing murmur and decreased femoral pulses, suggest a diagnosis of aortic dissection. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and hypertension increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and sweating, along with the presence of a diastolic blowing murmur and decreased femoral pulses, are consistent with a diagnosis of esophageal rupture. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and sweating, along with the presence of a grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border, are consistent with mitral valve prolapse. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and smoking increase the likelihood of mitral valve prolapse. Acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and esophageal rupture are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\n"}]
