It plays a key role in regulating the contraction of muscles and the transmission of signals between nerve cells and muscles.\n\n", "output1": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. It is released by neurons in the brain and spinal cord and binds to receptors on muscle cells, causing contraction.\n\n", "output2": "Deoxyribose is a type of sugar that is used as a source of energy for the nervous system. It plays a vital role in the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles.\n\n", "output3": "Oxytocin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles.

This is the most ventral (front) part of the spinal cord, and it contains the cell bodies of motor neurons that project to muscles throughout the body.\n\n", "output1": "The motor neuron cell bodies in the spinal cord are located in Lamina II. This is because Lamina II is the most proximal of the three laminae that contain motor neurons, and it is the first lamina to receive input from the brain.\n\n", "output2": "Motor neuron cell bodies are located in Lamina V of the spinal cord.

This is because the digastric muscle attaches to the anterior portion of the mandible and pulls the fragment downwards.\n\n", "output1": "The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for the movement of the posterior fragment of the mandible during an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible. This muscle pulls the posterior fragment anteriorly, causing the fracture to occur in this direction.\n\n", "output2": "When the body of the mandible is fractured, the temporalis muscle can cause the anterior fragment to be displaced backwards, resulting in a posterior displacement of the fragment.\n\n", "output3": "The medial pterygoid muscle is responsible for the displacement of the posterior fragment of the mandible in the event of an unfavourable fracture.

This is because the nerve is no longer present to send signals to the muscles, causing them to become overactive and rigid.\n\n", "output1": "If the nerve does not regenerate, the muscles it normally innervates will become flaccid and show signs of paralysis. This is because the nerve is not able to send signals to the muscles, causing them to become weak and inactive.\n\n", "output2": "If the nerve does not regenerate, the muscles it normally innervates will show signs of atrophy, which is the wasting away of muscle tissue. This is because the muscles are no longer receiving the normal signals from the nerve, and therefore do not receive the normal amount of stimulation and exercise. As a result, the muscles will shrink and become weaker over time.\n\n", "output3": "If the nerve does not regenerate, the muscles it innervates will show signs of contracture.
