This is because the high-intensity exercise involved in sprinting causes the breakdown of ATP and the accumulation of inorganic phosphate, which can lead to a decrease in muscle force production and an increase in muscle fatigue.\n\n", "output1": "The accumulation of inorganic phosphate is thought to contribute to the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. Hyperosmolality, or the excessive concentration of sugars in the muscles, can also contribute to this type of fatigue.\n\n", "output2": "Excessive antioxidant production can lead to the degradation of muscle glycogen, which is the primary fuel source for muscle contractions during high-intensity activities like sprinting. This can result in peripheral muscle fatigue.\n\n", "output3": "A lack of potassium is thought to be implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. Potassium is an important electrolyte that helps regulate muscle contractions and relaxation.

After this time, the ATP store is depleted and the body must rely on other sources of energy, such as glycogen, to sustain exercise.\n\n", "output2": "The ATP store in muscle can only supply energy for about 10 seconds of high-intensity exercise before it is depleted. This is because the ATP stores are limited and are used up quickly during intense physical activity.\n\n", "output3": "The ATP store in muscle can only supply energy for about 20 seconds of high-intensity exercise before it is depleted. This is why athletes often need to take breaks or rest periods during intense exercise to allow their ATP stores to replenish.\n\n"}, {"question": "960 mg of the antibacterial drug Cotrimoxazole is prescribed every 12 hours.
