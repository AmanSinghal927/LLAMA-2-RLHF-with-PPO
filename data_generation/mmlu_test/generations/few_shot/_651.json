This is because the pain is likely due to muscle strain, and bed rest will help to reduce the strain on the muscles and allow them to heal.

This is because the patient's symptoms are consistent with acute muscle strain, which can be treated with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE).

This is because the patient has a recent onset of low back pain, which is a common presentation for musculoskeletal injuries. Additionally, the patient has had one previous episode of low back pain that resolved spontaneously, which suggests that there may be an underlying structural issue that needs to be evaluated. The MRI will help to determine the extent of any soft tissue or disc injuries and guide further management.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because she has had increasingly severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past 2 days.
