This process is driven by the concentration gradient of H+ ions, which is created by the electron transport chain.\n\n", "output1": "The mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is passive diffusion, as it is a spontaneous process that occurs without the use of energy. The H+ ions diffuse back through the mitochondrial membrane by random motion, driven by their concentration gradient.\n\n", "output2": "The mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is active transport, specifically the proton pump.

This is because oxaloacetate is a product of the citric acid cycle, which requires oxygen to function properly. Without oxygen, the citric acid cycle cannot continue, and therefore, oxaloacetate production ceases.\n\n", "output1": "When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the pyruvate molecule will stop being produced first. This is because pyruvate is produced through the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen, and it is the first molecule to be produced in this process.\n\n", "output2": "When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the first molecule to stop being produced is water.

This is because the SDS coats the proteins with a uniform negative charge, which neutralizes any non-covalent interactions and allows the proteins to be separated solely on the basis of their size.\n\n", "output2": "Proteins are denatured during SDS-PAGE, which means that their native tertiary structure is disrupted. If the proteins are not treated with a detergent, such as SDS, before being run through the electrophoresis gel, the denaturation process can cause the proteins to aggregate and become difficult to separate based on their tertiary structure.
