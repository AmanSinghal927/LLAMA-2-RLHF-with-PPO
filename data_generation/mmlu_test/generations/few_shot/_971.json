This is because adrenaline increases the activity of enzymes involved in glucose and amino acid uptake, such as hexokinase and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.\n\n", "output1": "Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle by facilitating the transport of these molecules across the cell membrane.\n\n", "output2": "Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate that is stored in the liver and muscles. It is a readily available source of glucose for energy production and is also used to synthesize amino acids. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by muscle cells, and glycogen is an important source of glucose for muscle energy production.\n\n", "output3": "Cortisol is a hormone that promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. When cortisol levels are elevated, the body is able to use glucose and amino acids more efficiently for energy and muscle growth.\n\n"}, {"question": "When branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is mostly:", "correct_answer": "converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)converted into arginine and released from the muscle.", "B)converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.", "C)converted into urea and released from the muscle.", "D)used to synthesise purines and pyrimidines in the muscle."], "prompt": "When branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is mostly:A)converted into arginine and released from the muscle.\nB)converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.\nC)converted into urea and released from the muscle.\nD)used to synthesise purines and pyrimidines in the muscle.", "subject_name": "college_medicine", "output0": "When branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is converted into arginine and released from the muscle. This is because the liver is not able to metabolize BCAAs, so the muscle is responsible for their metabolism.\n\n", "output1": "When branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is converted into alanine and glutamine, which are then released from the muscle. This process helps to remove excess ammonia from the muscle and prevent it from accumulating to toxic levels.\n\n", "output2": "The branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are deaminated in muscle, producing ammonia. This ammonia is then converted into urea, which is released from the muscle.\n\n", "output3": "The branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are deaminated in muscle to produce ammonia. This ammonia is then used to synthesise purines and pyrimidines in the muscle, which are important for the growth and maintenance of muscle tissue.\n\n"}, {"question": "A certain molecule acts by binding to cytochrome oxidase A3, the final enzyme in the electron transport chain.

If this enzyme is blocked, the cell would be unable to pass electrons to oxygen, thus stopping aerobic respiration and leading to asphyxiation.\n\n", "output1": "The molecule in question, cytochrome oxidase A3, is the final enzyme in the electron transport chain. It is responsible for accepting a phosphate group from ATP and transferring it to oxygen, resulting in the production of ATP. If this enzyme is blocked, the cell would be unable to produce ATP through aerobic respiration, leading to a decrease in ATP availability and ultimately, death.\n\n", "output2": "When a molecule binds to cytochrome oxidase A3, it blocks the electron transport chain and prevents the cell from using aerobic respiration to produce ATP. However, cells can switch to anaerobic metabolism to produce ATP, so the lack of ATP production due to the blocked electron transport chain would not have a significant effect on the cell.\n\n", "output3": "When a large dose of the molecule that binds to cytochrome oxidase A3 is administered to a human, it would block the electron transport chain and prevent the cell from passing electrons to oxygen. However, the cell would still need to produce ATP to maintain its basic functions. Therefore, the cell would up-regulate anaerobic pathways to compensate for the lack of ATP production through aerobic respiration. This would lead to an increase in ATP production, rather than a decrease, as might be expected.\n\n"}, {"question": "In response to period of extreme psychological trauma, a patient begins experiencing a feeling of detachment.

This allows the muscle to sustain activity for longer periods of time without fatigue.\n\n", "output2": "Endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to burn fat and carbohydrate as a source of energy. This is because the muscle fibers are trained to work for longer periods of time, which requires the use of stored fat and carbohydrate as fuel.\n\n", "output3": "Endurance training is designed to increase the muscle's capacity to generate energy anaerobically, which means without the use of oxygen.
