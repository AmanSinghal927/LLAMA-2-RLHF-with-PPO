A fall in the cell concentration of ADP is one of the main causes of fatigue during high-intensity exercise, as it reduces the amount of energy available for muscle contraction.\n\n", "output1": "When we perform high-intensity exercise, our muscles require a large amount of ATP to function properly. However, the supply of ATP cannot keep up with the demand, leading to fatigue. This is because the body's energy production system is not able to meet the high energy demands of the muscles.\n\n", "output2": "When performing high-intensity exercise, the body's demand for ATP increases significantly. If the ATP supply does not match this demand, fatigue will result. This is the primary cause of fatigue in high-intensity exercise.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)lack of skill. Fatigue in high intensity exercise is often caused by a lack of skill or technique, rather than a lack of physical fitness or endurance.
