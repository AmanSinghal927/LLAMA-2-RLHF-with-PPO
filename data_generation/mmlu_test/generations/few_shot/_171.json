This is a critical step in the wound healing process, as the collagen fibers help to maintain the shape of the wound and provide the necessary structure for the new tissue to grow.\n\n", "output1": "Collagen fibres are an important part of the wound healing process, and they help to provide a bridge across the surface of a wound. This bridge helps to support the wound and promote healing.\n\n", "output2": "Collagen fibres take some time to re-establish in the wound healing process. This is because they are broken down during the injury and need time to regenerate and reorganize.\n\n", "output3": "Collagen fibers are not needed in wound healing by primary intention because the wound is healing from the inside out, and the collagen fibers are not necessary for the wound to close.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following releases most energy when completely oxidised in the body?", "correct_answer": "One gram of palmitic acid", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)One gram of glucose", "B)One gram of palmitic acid", "C)One gram of leucine", "D)One gram of alcohol"], "prompt": "Which of the following releases most energy when completely oxidised in the body?A)One gram of glucose\nB)One gram of palmitic acid\nC)One gram of leucine\nD)One gram of alcohol", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "One gram of glucose releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body because it is the body's primary source of energy.

Instead, it is the enzyme pyruvate kinase that is the rate-limiting step in glycolysis.\n\n", "output1": "Phosphorylase activity is actually higher in Type I fibres than in Type II fibres. This is because Type I fibres are more efficient at producing ATP through glycolysis, and therefore require more phosphorylase enzymes to produce the necessary ATP.\n\n", "output2": "Endurance training does not increase the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle. In fact, endurance training can actually decrease the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle, as the muscle is using more fat as a fuel source and less glucose.\n\n", "output3": "Oxygen is not consumed in the TCA cycle.
