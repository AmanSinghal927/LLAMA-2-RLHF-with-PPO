It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, which can help to reduce the perception of pain. However, morphine can also cause sedation, which can be a side effect of the medication.\n\n", "output1": "Morphine is a powerful opioid medication that is commonly used to treat moderate to severe pain. One of its main effects is to reduce pain intensity, but it can also cause sedation, which is a common side effect. This means that morphine can make a person feel drowsy or disoriented, which can be beneficial for patients who are experiencing severe pain.\n\n", "output2": "Morphine is a pain medication that can effectively reduce pain intensity. However, it can also cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhoea.\n\n", "output3": "Morphine is a powerful pain medication that can help reduce pain intensity.

This allows the blood to flow into the ventricles and be pumped out to the body.\n\n", "output1": "When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood out into the vessels, which then contract to maintain the pressure of the blood. This is known as the \"vascular resistance\" of the circulatory system.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)the right ventricle is relaxed. When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood into the pulmonary artery, which is then carried to the lungs. During this process, the right ventricle relaxes, allowing blood to flow back into the heart from the pulmonary veins. This ensures that blood continues to flow through the vessels even when the left ventricle is contracting.\n\n", "output3": "When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood into the aorta, which then stretches and causes the arteries to expand. This elastic recoil allows the blood to continue flowing through the vessels even after the contraction has ended.\n\n"}, {"question": "What might make the nurse think a patient could not use an inhaler?", "correct_answer": "Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Severe leg ulcers.", "B)Previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma.", "C)Forthcoming surgery.", "D)Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding."], "prompt": "What might make the nurse think a patient could not use an inhaler?A)Severe leg ulcers.\nB)Previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma.\nC)Forthcoming surgery.\nD)Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding.", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "Severe leg ulcers may make it difficult for a patient to use an inhaler properly.
