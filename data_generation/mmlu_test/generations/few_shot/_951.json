[{"question": "Which of the following releases most energy when completely oxidised in the body?", "correct_answer": "One gram of palmitic acid", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)One gram of glucose", "B)One gram of palmitic acid", "C)One gram of leucine", "D)One gram of alcohol"], "prompt": "Which of the following releases most energy when completely oxidised in the body?A)One gram of glucose\nB)One gram of palmitic acid\nC)One gram of leucine\nD)One gram of alcohol", "subject_name": "college_medicine", "output0": "One gram of glucose releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body. This is because glucose is a simple sugar that is easily broken down and converted into energy. In contrast, the other options (palmitic acid, leucine, and alcohol) are all more complex molecules that require more energy to break down and convert into usable energy.\n\n", "output1": "Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid, which is more easily broken down and released as energy in the body compared to other types of fatty acids. Additionally, it is a major component of the cell membrane, which makes it easily accessible to the body's energy-producing processes.\n\n", "output2": "Leucine is an amino acid that is a key player in the regulation of energy metabolism. When completely oxidized in the body, leucine releases more energy than glucose, palmitic acid, or alcohol.\n\n", "output3": "When completely oxidized, one gram of alcohol releases the most energy in the body. Alcohol is a high-energy molecule that can be easily metabolized by the body to produce ATP, the energy currency of the body.\n\n"}, {"question": "An individual is born with a mutation causing her to partially retain a form of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood.

Fetal hemoglobin is functionally equivalent to adult hemoglobin, so there would be no differences in oxygen binding between the two.\n\n", "output1": "If the individual has a mutation causing them to retain fetal hemoglobin, which is a type of hemoglobin found in the blood of fetuses and newborns, then they would have significantly reduced oxygen binding in the lungs. This is because fetal hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, which means it is less effective at carrying oxygen to the body's tissues. This could lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and difficulty exercising.\n\n", "output2": "Retention of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood is fatal, so the individual would likely experience severe symptoms and death. Fetal hemoglobin is not adapted to the adult environment, and its retention would cause a range of complications.\n\n", "output3": "Individuals with fetal hemoglobin have a higher affinity for oxygen than normal adults, so they can bind more oxygen to their hemoglobin in the tissues. This can result in increased oxygen delivery to the tissues and potentially improve overall oxygenation.\n\n"}, {"question": "Women's world record performances have improved rapidly in recent years mainly because:", "correct_answer": "more women are now engaged in sport.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)women have evolved a greater muscle mass.", "B)women can now run faster than men.", "C)women have started training at an earlier age.", "D)more women are now engaged in sport."], "prompt": "Women's world record performances have improved rapidly in recent years mainly because:A)women have evolved a greater muscle mass.\nB)women can now run faster than men.\nC)women have started training at an earlier age.\nD)more women are now engaged in sport.", "subject_name": "college_medicine", "output0": "Women's world record performances have improved rapidly in recent years mainly because women have evolved a greater muscle mass. This has allowed them to generate more power and speed in their athletic performances.\n\n", "output1": "The women's world record performances have improved rapidly in recent years because women have been able to run faster than men. This is due to a number of factors, including advances in training and technology, as well as the increasing participation of women in sports.\n\n", "output2": "The rapid improvement in women's world record performances in recent years is largely due to women starting to train at an earlier age. This has allowed them to develop their physical and technical skills at a younger age, which has led to improved performance.\n\n", "output3": "Women's world record performances have improved rapidly in recent years mainly because more women are now engaged in sport and have access to better training facilities, coaching, and nutrition. This has led to a significant increase in the number of women competing at the highest levels of sport, which in turn has driven improvements in performance.\n\n"}, {"question": "During muscular contraction, interactions between myosin and actin allow for shortening of each sarcomere.

During muscular contraction, myosin and actin interact to produce movement, and this interaction requires ATP to occur.\n\n", "output2": "Calcium-troponin interaction is required for muscle contraction. When calcium ions bind to troponin, the actin-tropomyosin complex is disrupted, allowing for muscle contraction to occur. This process requires ATP, as the binding of calcium ions to troponin is an energy-demanding process.\n\n", "output3": "Myosin-actin detachment is the process of muscle contraction that requires ATP.

This is particularly relevant in muscle tissue, where the activity of CK can be used as an indicator of muscle damage or fatigue.\n\n", "output1": "The activity of creatine kinase (CK) is increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9 because CK is an enzyme that is sensitive to pH changes. When muscle pH drops, CK activity increases to help regulate the concentration of ATP and ADP in the muscle.\n\n", "output2": "Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme that is found in high concentrations in Type II muscle fibers. These fibers are responsible for generating quick, powerful movements, but they are also prone to injury and fatigue. As a result, CK is always lower in Type II fibers than in Type I fibers, which are responsible for slower, more enduring movements.\n\n", "output3": "The activity of creatine kinase is increased after a period of endurance training because the muscles have been subjected to repetitive stress and strain, which causes an increase in muscle damage and the release of creatine kinase into the bloodstream.\n\n"}, {"question": "A teacher sets up a reward system for her elementary school students.

This schedule, which involves giving rewards on average every 3-5 times, creates the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction. As a result, the students were more motivated to perform well on the quizzes in order to receive the rewards, but they were less motivated to change their tardy behavior.\n\n", "output1": "The teacher\u2019s observation that performance on quizzes increased significantly but tardiness only decreased slightly can be explained by the fact that the students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.

This type of schedule, in which a reward is given after a certain number of correct responses or completed tasks, can lead to stronger behavior change than a variable-interval schedule, in which rewards are given at unpredictable intervals. However, the teacher\u2019s use of a fixed-ratio schedule may not have been effective in reducing tardiness, as this behavior is more complex and may require a different type of reinforcement.\n\n"}, {"question": "The net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis is:", "correct_answer": "2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.", "B)2 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.", "C)3 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.", "D)3 from glucose and 2 from glycogen."], "prompt": "The net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis is:A)2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.\nB)2 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.\nC)3 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.\nD)3 from glucose and 2 from glycogen.", "subject_name": "college_medicine", "output0": "The net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis is 2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.
