Stomata are small openings on the surface of the plant that allow for gas exchange, but they also allow for water loss. By having numerous stomata, the plant can release excess water vapor into the air, which helps to minimize water loss.\n\n", "output1": "Plants adapt to minimize water loss in environments with high temperatures by developing thin cuticles. This reduces the amount of water lost through transpiration.\n\n", "output2": "Plants in environments with high temperatures often have spines instead of leaves to minimize water loss. Leaves are more susceptible to water loss through transpiration, so plants have adapted to reduce their surface area by developing spines instead of leaves.\n\n", "output3": "Plants adapt to high temperatures by minimizing water loss through transpiration. One way they do this is by developing large surface-to-volume ratios, which allows them to release heat more quickly and reduce the amount of water lost through transpiration.\n\n"}, {"question": "All of the following might be found in connective tissue EXCEPT", "correct_answer": "thrombin", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)thrombin", "B)glycosaminoglycans", "C)collagens", "D)fibroblasts"], "prompt": "All of the following might be found in connective tissue EXCEPTA)thrombin\nB)glycosaminoglycans\nC)collagens\nD)fibroblasts", "subject_name": "college_biology", "output0": "Thrombin is a protein found in connective tissue that plays a crucial role in blood clotting.
