This is why covering one eye does not necessarily eliminate diplopia.\n\n", "output1": "Diplopia is a condition in which an individual sees two images of a single object. The outer image is always the false image in diplopia, as the inner image is the one that is being seen by the patient. This is because the outer image is the one that is being projected onto the retina, while the inner image is the one that is being perceived by the brain.\n\n", "output2": "A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards because the fourth cranial nerve controls the medial rectus muscle of the eye, which is responsible for looking up and down. When this nerve is palsied, the medial rectus muscle is weakened or paralyzed, causing the eye to deviate upwards.\n\n", "output3": "A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint because the sixth nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for turning the eyes outward. When this muscle is paralyzed, the eye will turn inward, causing a divergent squint.\n\n"}, {"question": "Sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance by:", "correct_answer": "elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.", "B)reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.", "C)elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle.", "D)elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH."], "prompt": "Sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance by:A)elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\nB)reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\nC)elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle.\nD)elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH.", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "Sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance by increasing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, which allows a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.
