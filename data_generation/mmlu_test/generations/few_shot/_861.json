This is because the theory suggests that the pollen grains were exposed to water, which caused the starch granules inside the pollen grains to swell. As a result, the interior of the pollen grains became hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment, leading to the release of the starch granules and the triggering of an asthmatic attack.\n\n", "output1": "According to the theory, the interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding environment. This caused the starch granules to be released from the pollen grains as a result of osmotic shock.\n\n", "output2": "The theory you mentioned suggests that exposure to water causes the pollen grains to undergo plasmolysis, which is the shrinking of the cell and the release of its contents. This process is thought to be the mechanism by which the starch granules are released from the pollen grains and trigger an asthmatic attack.\n\n", "output3": "According to the theory, the pollen grains undergo shrinking before they rupture and release their contents. This process is known as plasmolysis, and it is a common phenomenon in plant cells exposed to water.\n\n"}, {"question": "Hybrids between some related species of plants are sterile because the parent plants had different chromosome numbers.

As a result, it would be unlikely to have any descendants.\n\n", "output1": "The descendants of plants with a double chromosome number would have a higher degree of genetic variation than their parents, which could give them an advantage in terms of adaptability and survival. This is because the double chromosome number allows for the recombination of genetic material from both parental species, leading to increased genetic variation.\n\n", "output2": "The descendants of hybrid plants with a double chromosome number are reproductively successful because they can backcross with the parental species. This is because the double chromosome number allows for proper chromosome pairing and sexual reproduction.\n\n", "output3": "When a plant with a double chromosome number reproduces sexually, the paired chromosomes can line up correctly and be passed on to the offspring.
