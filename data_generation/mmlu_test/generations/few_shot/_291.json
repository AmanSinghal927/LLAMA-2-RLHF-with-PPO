This is in contrast to other types of masses, such as a solid tumor, which would not be pulsatile.\n\n", "output1": "An enlarged kidney is typically dull to percussion, meaning that it does not produce a distinct sound when tapped. This is because the enlarged kidney is often filled with fluid, which can cause it to feel soft and non-palpable.\n\n", "output2": "The correct answer is C)A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst. This is because a large mass arising from the pelvis that disappears following urethral catheterization is a common presentation of an ovarian cyst.\n\n", "output3": "An indentible mass in the colon is caused by faecal loading, which is a common finding in older children and adolescents. This is because the colon is not fully developed in these age groups, and the faeces can accumulate and cause a mass-like appearance.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a category used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale?", "correct_answer": "Pupil response.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Eye opening.", "B)Verbal response.", "C)Best motor response.", "D)Pupil response."], "prompt": "Which of the following is not a category used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale?A)Eye opening.\nB)Verbal response.\nC)Best motor response.\nD)Pupil response.", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "Eye opening is not a category used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale.
