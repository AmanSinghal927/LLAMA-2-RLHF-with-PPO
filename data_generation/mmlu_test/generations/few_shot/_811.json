In other words, the development of the embryo passes through the same stages that the species went through in its evolutionary history.\n\n", "output1": "Early embryos, regardless of their species, share many similar features. This is because embryonic development is controlled by the same genetic and molecular mechanisms across different species. Therefore, embryos of different species can be studied together to gain insights into the developmental processes that underlie the evolution of different species.\n\n", "output2": "The concept of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny states that the development of an organism from embryo to adult reflects the evolutionary history of the species.
