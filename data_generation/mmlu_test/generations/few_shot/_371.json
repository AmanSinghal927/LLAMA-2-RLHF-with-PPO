It is a leading cause of stoma formation, as the chronic inflammation and scarring that can result from IBS can lead to the formation of stomas.\n\n", "output1": "Haemorrhoids are a common cause of stoma formation. They occur when the veins in the rectum become swollen and cause a bulge, which can lead to a stoma.\n\n", "output2": "One of the most common reasons for stoma formation is carcinoma, specifically colorectal cancer. This is because the tumor can grow and obstruct the intestine, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. If left untreated, the tumor can progress and require surgical intervention, which may result in the formation of a stoma.\n\n", "output3": "Bladders instability is a common cause of stoma formation.
