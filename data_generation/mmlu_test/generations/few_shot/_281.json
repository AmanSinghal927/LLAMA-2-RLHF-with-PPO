Clubbing is characterized by a more horizontal nail-bed angle, which can be difficult to assess from other angles.\n\n", "output1": "The most reliable way to assess for clubbing is by assessing the fluctuancy of the nail-bed. This is because the nail-bed will fluctuate in response to changes in the underlying tissue, such as the presence of a clubbed nail. Inspecting the nail-bed angle from above or from the side can also be useful, but they may not be as reliable as assessing the fluctuancy of the nail-bed.\n\n", "output2": "Schamroth's sign is a reliable indicator of clubbing.
