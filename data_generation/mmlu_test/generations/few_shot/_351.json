This allows the muscle to generate more force and work for longer periods of time.\n\n", "output1": "Endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to break down phosphocreatine, which is a high-energy compound that is stored in muscles. When this compound is broken down, it provides energy for the muscle to contract for longer periods of time.\n\n", "output2": "Endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to burn fat and carbohydrate as a source of energy. This is because endurance exercises, such as running or cycling, are designed to be sustained for a long period of time, which requires the muscles to use stored energy sources like fat and carbohydrate.\n\n", "output3": "Endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to generate energy anaerobically. This means that the muscle can produce energy without the use of oxygen.
