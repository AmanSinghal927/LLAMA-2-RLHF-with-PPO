Glutamine is a precursor to glutamate, which is an important neurotransmitter in the brain. When glutamine is converted to glutamate, it can help to maintain the proper balance of pH in the brain.\n\n", "output1": "Glucose is an intracellular buffer that can help to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. When glycolysis is rapid, the production of NADH and FADH2 can cause an increase in the intracellular concentration of protons (H+ ions), which can lead to a decrease in pH. Glucose can help to buffer this increase in pH by accepting protons and forming glucose-6-phosphate, which can then be converted back to glucose.\n\n", "output2": "Carnosine is an intracellular buffer that can help to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. It does this by acting as a pH buffer, maintaining the cell's pH within a narrow range.\n\n", "output3": "Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars. It can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high by hydrolyzing the carbohydrates into glucose, which can then be used to replenish ATP and maintain cellular pH balance.\n\n"}, {"question": "A team of engineers constructing signal lights for airplanes that they can use to guide them to runways are attempting to determine the brightness needed for the pilot to be able to detect the tower at 1 mile away.
