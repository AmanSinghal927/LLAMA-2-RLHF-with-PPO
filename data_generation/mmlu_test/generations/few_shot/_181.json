Insulin stimulates the uptake and storage of glucose in the muscle, and also promotes the breakdown of glycogen to glucose for energy production.\n\n", "output1": "Cortisol is a hormone that is released in response to stress, and it plays a role in the breakdown of glycogen in the muscle. When we exercise, our muscles use glycogen as a source of energy. Cortisol helps to release the glycogen from the muscle fibers so that it can be used as energy.\n\n", "output2": "The breakdown of glycogen in exercising muscle is activated by the increase in pH that occurs during exercise. This increase in pH triggers the breakdown of glycogen stores in the muscle.\n\n", "output3": "Glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is activated by neither insulin nor cortisol. Instead, it is activated by the depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle, which occurs when the muscle is subjected to physical activity.\n\n"}, {"question": "Most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood:", "correct_answer": "bound to albumin.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)inside the red blood cells.", "B)as lipoproteins.", "C)combined with glucose.", "D)bound to albumin."], "prompt": "Most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood:A)inside the red blood cells.\nB)as lipoproteins.\nC)combined with glucose.\nD)bound to albumin.", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "Most of the free fatty acids are transported inside the red blood cells because the cells' membranes are impermeable to fatty acids. Therefore, the fatty acids are esterified to form glycerol-3-phosphate, which is then transported into the red blood cells.\n\n", "output1": "Most of the free fatty acids in the blood are transported as lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are complexes of proteins and lipids that are transported in the blood. They are composed of a core of triglycerides and cholesterol, surrounded by proteins such as apolipoprotein A-1 and apolipoprotein B. Free fatty acids are attached to the surface of the lipoproteins, allowing them to be transported in the blood.\n\n", "output2": "Free fatty acids are transported in the blood as part of the lipid transport complex, which is a complex of lipoproteins and apolipoproteins.\n\n", "output3": "Most of the free fatty acids are bound to albumin, which is a carrier protein in the blood.

When ADP levels increase, the activity of creatine kinase also increases, as it is responsible for converting ADP into ATP.\n\n", "output1": "Creatine kinase is an enzyme that is released into the bloodstream when muscle fibers are damaged or undergo excessive stress. This can occur when the muscle pH falls below 6.9, which is the normal range for this enzyme. Therefore, an increase in creatine kinase activity is often used as an indicator of muscle damage or stress.\n\n", "output2": "Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme that is present in high concentrations in muscle fibers, particularly in Type II fibers. It plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism during exercise. The activity of CK is always lower in Type II fibers than in Type I fibers.\n\n", "output3": "Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme that is found in muscle tissue and is responsible for converting creatine to phosphocreatine. When muscles are subjected to endurance training, the demand for energy from ATP increases, leading to an increase in the activity of CK. This is why CK activity is typically higher after a period of endurance training.\n\n"}, {"question": "The smallest increments on a mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometer measure are:", "correct_answer": "2 mmHg.", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)10 mmHg.", "B)4 mmHg.", "C)2 mmHg.", "D)1 mmHg."], "prompt": "The smallest increments on a mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometer measure are:A)10 mmHg.\nB)4 mmHg.\nC)2 mmHg.\nD)1 mmHg.", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "The smallest increment on a mercury sphygmomanometer is 10 mmHg, which is the smallest amount that the mercury column can move.
