This can cause the nodule to become more prominent and visible.\n\n", "output1": "Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign because it indicates that the immune system is actively fighting the cancer. This means that the cancer is more likely to be treatable and the patient has a better prognosis.\n\n", "output2": "An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone because it can show the presence of blood flow in the nodule. This can indicate that the nodule is actively secreting hormone.\n\n", "output3": "A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer because cancerous nodules do not take up radioactive isotopes in the same way as normal thyroid tissue. This is why isotope scanning is often used to help diagnose thyroid nodules and determine whether they are cancerous.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is true of hepatomegaly?", "correct_answer": "The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Emphysema is a cause", "B)The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium", "C)The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause", "D)The liver is usually resonant to percussion"], "prompt": "Which of the following is true of hepatomegaly?A)Emphysema is a cause\nB)The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium\nC)The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause\nD)The liver is usually resonant to percussion", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "Emphysema can cause hepatomegaly, which is the enlargement of the liver. Emphysema is a condition in which the air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which can lead to liver enlargement.\n\n", "output1": "When the liver becomes enlarged, it typically does so downwards from the left hypochondrium, which is the area just below the rib cage. This is because the liver is a soft, flexible organ that can easily become enlarged in response to various conditions, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis.\n\n", "output2": "The presence of jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura are indicative of liver disease, and alcohol is a common cause of liver disease.\n\n", "output3": "The liver is usually resonant to percussion because it is a soft, spongy organ.

This is because the Babinski reflex is a flexor response that is elicited by tapping the patellar tendon with a tendon hammer. A positive Babinski reflex indicates that the corticospinal tracts are intact and that there is no significant lesion in the lower motor neurons.\n\n", "output1": "An extensor plantar response indicates a lower motor neurone lesion because it is a reflex that is mediated by the lower motor neurones. These neurones are responsible for transmitting signals from the central nervous system to the muscles and glands.\n\n", "output2": "The root value of the ankle reflex is S1 because the S1 nerve root is responsible for controlling the muscles of the foot and ankle. When the S1 nerve root is damaged, it can cause a positive Babinski reflex, which is characterized by a rapid, spastic extension of the great toe and flexion of the other toes.\n\n", "output3": "The knee reflex is a monosynaptic reflex that is mediated by the L1 and L2 spinal nerves.

It is an upper motor neurone lesion, meaning that it affects the nerve fibers that transmit signals from the brain to the muscles.\n\n", "output2": "An inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side indicates a lower motor neurone lesion because the facial nerve controls the muscles of the eyelid, and if there is damage to the lower motor neurones, the eyelid will be paralysed and unable to close.\n\n", "output3": "Bell's Palsy is a condition that affects the facial nerve, causing weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles.
