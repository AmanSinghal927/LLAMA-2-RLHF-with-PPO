This can cause a lack of menstruation and infertility. The patient's symptoms of emaciation, low blood pressure, and slow pulse are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n", "output2": "The most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea is hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhea due to the inhibition of gonadotropin secretion.

PCOS is a common endocrine disorder that affects 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by irregular menstrual periods, obesity, and insulin resistance. The patient's history of irregular periods and lack of concern about the lack of menses are consistent with PCOS. Additionally, her emaciation and low BMI are also consistent with PCOS, as many women with PCOS have difficulty maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination.
