This is because when close relatives marry and have children, the risk of passing on genetic mutations increases.\n\n", "output1": "Consanguinity, or the practice of marrying close relatives, can lead to an increased risk of certain genetic disorders due to the higher chance of passing on harmful recessive genes. As a result, consanguinity shows a strong association with autosomal recessive inheritance patterns.\n\n", "output2": "Consanguinity is a term used to describe the practice of marrying close relatives. When two individuals who are related to each other have children, the risk of passing on genetic disorders increases. X-linked dominant disorders are those that are caused by mutations in genes located on the X chromosome. These disorders are more likely to be expressed in males, who have only one X chromosome, than in females, who have two X chromosomes. Therefore, consanguinity is more likely to result in the transmission of X-linked dominant disorders.\n\n", "output3": "Consanguinity is associated with X-linked recessive inheritance because it increases the chances of two carriers of a recessive gene having a child with the condition.
