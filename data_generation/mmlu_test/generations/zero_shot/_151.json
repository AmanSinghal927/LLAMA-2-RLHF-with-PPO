When you swallow, the esophagus contracts and pushes the thyroid gland upward, causing the swelling to become more prominent. This is why a thyroid swelling will always elevate on swallowing.\n\n", "output1": "Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign because it indicates that the immune system is actively fighting the cancer. This is a good sign because it means that the cancer is more likely to be treatable and less likely to have spread to other parts of the body.\n\n", "output2": "Because the ultrasound can show if the nodule is producing hormones by measuring the blood flow to the nodule. If the nodule is actively secreting hormones, it will have a higher blood flow than a non-functioning nodule. Additionally, an ultrasound can also help to determine the size and location of the nodule.\n\n", "output3": "Because functioning nodules are typically seen on scintigraphy as areas of increased uptake of the isotope, and cancerous nodules are typically seen as areas of decreased uptake. This is because cancerous nodules are more likely to have a higher turnover rate and therefore take up the isotope more quickly, leading to decreased uptake in the later images.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following is true of hepatomegaly?", "correct_answer": "The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause", "correct_idx": 2, "options": ["A)Emphysema is a cause", "B)The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium", "C)The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause", "D)The liver is usually resonant to percussion"], "prompt": "Which of the following is true of hepatomegaly?A)Emphysema is a cause\nB)The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium\nC)The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause\nD)The liver is usually resonant to percussion", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "Emphysema can cause hepatomegaly due to the increased pressure in the chest cavity, which can cause the liver to become enlarged.

If there is a lesion in this area, the extensor muscles will be inhibited, resulting in an extensor plantar response.\n\n", "output2": "The ankle reflex, also known as the plantar reflex, is a monosynaptic reflex that involves the S1 nerve root. The S1 nerve root is the sole motor nerve that innervates the muscles of the foot and ankle. Therefore, the root value of the ankle reflex is S1.\n\n", "output3": "The knee reflex is a spinal reflex that is mediated by the L1 and L2 nerve roots. The L1 and L2 nerve roots are responsible for controlling the extension of the knee joint. When the knee is stretched, the L1 and L2 nerve roots are activated, causing the quadriceps muscle to contract and the patella to move upward.

This means that the infection can affect the nerves in the brain that control the facial muscles, leading to paralysis of the facial muscles on one side.\n\n", "output2": "Because the facial nerve controls the eyelid muscles, if the facial nerve is damaged, the eyelid on the paralysed side will be unable to close.
