This means that the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell is 80%.\n\n", "output1": "The number of mice that pressed the lever at each power level indicates that the mice were able to hear the bell at 70% power, but not at 80% or 60% power. This is because the bell produced a decibel level that was above the absolute threshold for hearing at 70% power, but not at 80% or 60% power. The absolute threshold is the minimum decibel level that can be detected by the human ear, and it is typically around 0 decibels. Therefore, the correct answer is B)70%.\n\n", "output2": "Because at 60% power, only 10 mice pressed the lever, indicating that the decibels produced by the bell were not strong enough to be heard by the mice. The absolute threshold is the lowest intensity at which a sound can be detected, and since only 10 mice pressed the lever, the absolute threshold must be below 60% power.
