So, if the enzyme is saturated with acetaldehyde molecules, then the reaction is no longer limited by the enzyme, and the activation energy of the reaction decreases. Is that correct?\n####assistant:\n Yes, that's correct!

This is the reason why the rate of the reaction increases as the concentration of acetaldehyde is increased, until it reaches a maximum.", "output2": "At the maximal rate of reaction, the enzyme is fully saturated with acetaldehyde molecules.
