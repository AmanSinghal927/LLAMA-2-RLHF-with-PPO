But what about the other options?\n####assistant:\n Option B is incorrect because SARMs do not act as antagonists to natural steroid hormones. Instead, they mimic the effects of these hormones. Option C is also incorrect because SARMs are not non-steroid drugs. They are steroid drugs that selectively bind to androgen receptors.
