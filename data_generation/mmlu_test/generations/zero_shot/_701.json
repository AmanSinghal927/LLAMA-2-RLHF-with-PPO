Additionally, it can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce the quality of sleep. By discontinuing the bedtime drink of alcohol, the patient's sleep will be more consolidated and the awakening at night will be reduced.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's insomnia is likely due to his early awakening being related to arousal from sleep. The patient is physically active, but he does not have any other symptoms that would suggest a medical or psychiatric cause of his insomnia. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to advise the patient to read and snack in bed to relax, which may help him to fall back asleep.\n\n", "output2": "The patient's insomnia is likely due to his high level of physical activity during the day, which is causing him to feel overstimulated and unable to wind down at night. Prescribing a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen will only exacerbate the problem. It is important to recommend a relaxing pre-bedtime routine to help the patient wind down and prepare for sleep.\n\n", "output3": "The correct answer is D)Prescribe sertraline because the patient's symptoms of early awakening at night and difficulty falling back asleep are consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia. Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is the first-line medication for insomnia. It works by increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain, which helps to regulate sleep and wakefulness. Additionally, sertraline has a positive effect on mood and can help to reduce anxiety, which may contribute to insomnia.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician 3 months after she had a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg at a routine examination prior to participation in school sports.

Additionally, the patient's fetal heart rate of 144/min is consistent with coarctation of the aorta.

He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Range of motion of the neck is decreased due to pain. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.

Cluster headaches are characterized by severe, one-sided headaches that can be accompanied by tearing and redness of the eye on the same side, as well as pain and stiffness in the neck. The patient's age and lack of history of severe headaches also support this diagnosis. Meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage are less likely given the patient's lack of other symptoms and the absence of meningism or focal neurological findings. Migraine is also less likely given the sudden onset of the headache and the patient's age.\n\n", "output1": "The patient's sudden onset of severe headache and stiff neck, along with his hypertension and lack of other symptoms, are consistent with meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The patient's hypertension may be a risk factor for meningitis, as it can increase the risk of blood vessel inflammation. Additionally, the patient's age is also a risk factor for meningitis, as the disease is more common in older adults. Cluster headache, migraine, and subarachnoid hemorrhage are less likely diagnoses for this patient.\n\n", "output2": "A migraine is a common cause of severe headache, especially if it is accompanied by a stiff neck. The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of a severe headache and stiff neck are consistent with a migraine. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are also common comorbidities with migraines. The fact that the patient has not had any other symptoms and has no history of severe headache suggests that this is not a more severe condition such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's sudden onset of severe headache and stiff neck, along with the absence of any other symptoms, is consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's hypertension and history of gastroesophageal reflux disease also increase his risk for this condition. Additionally, the patient's age and the absence of any focal neurological findings on examination are also consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n"}]
