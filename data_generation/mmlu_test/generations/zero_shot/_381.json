However, in longer duration events (more than 10 minutes), the low carbohydrate intake may impair exercise performance.\n\n", "output1": "Because the low intake of carbohydrate in the diet can lead to a decrease in muscle glycogen stores, which can affect the resting muscle pH.\n\n", "output2": "When the body is in a state of low carbohydrate availability, it may not be able to maintain high intensity exercise for as long as it would be able to in a state of normal carbohydrate availability. This is because the body relies on carbohydrates as its primary source of energy for high intensity exercise. Without enough carbohydrates, the body may not be able to sustain high intensity exercise for as long.\n\n", "output3": "Because when the body has low intake of carbohydrate, it relies more on muscle glycogen for energy during exercise, which can lead to a decrease in high intensity exercise performance.\n\n"}, {"question": "Phophocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise is inhibited by:", "correct_answer": "a lack of oxygen.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)an excess of creatine.", "B)hyperventilation.", "C)an excess of oxygen.", "D)a lack of oxygen."], "prompt": "Phophocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise is inhibited by:A)an excess of creatine.\nB)hyperventilation.\nC)an excess of oxygen.\nD)a lack of oxygen.", "subject_name": "clinical_knowledge", "output0": "When creatine is ingested in large amounts, it can inhibit the resynthesis of phosphocreatine during recovery from exercise. This is because the excess creatine in the muscle cells competes with the body's own creatine stores for uptake into the muscle fibers. As a result, the body's own creatine stores are depleted, and the resynthesis of phosphocreatine is inhibited.\n\n", "output1": "When you exercise, you breathe more rapidly to increase oxygen delivery to your muscles. However, if you hyperventilate, you breathe too quickly and excessively, which can lead to a drop in blood pH and a decrease in the amount of oxygen available to your muscles. This can inhibit the resynthesis of phosphocreatine during recovery from exercise.\n\n", "output2": "When you exercise, your muscles use up ATP, which is then replaced by creatine phosphate. During recovery, the body needs to replenish the ATP stores. If there is too much oxygen present, the body will use up the ATP stores too quickly, inhibiting the resynthesis of phosphocreatine.\n\n", "output3": "During exercise, your body uses oxygen to break down ATP and produce energy. When you recover from exercise, your body needs to resynthesize ATP to replenish the energy stores in your muscles. This process is inhibited by a lack of oxygen, as oxygen is required for the resynthesis of ATP.
