Diplopia requires two separate images being projected onto the retina, one from each eye. If one eye is covered, there is no second image to create diplopia.\n\n", "output1": "In diplopia, the outer image is always the false image because the inner eye is always the one that is deviated. So, when one eye is covered, the outer image is the only image that is visible, and it is always the false image.\n\n", "output2": "A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the medial rectus muscle is weakened or paralyzed, causing the eye to look upwards. This can result in diplopia, or double vision, especially when the patient looks upwards.\n\n", "output3": "A sixth nerve palsy affects the abducens nerve, which controls the lateral movement of the eye. When this nerve is damaged, the eye will have difficulty moving outward, causing a divergent squint.

In the first few seconds of high intensity exercise, the body relies on stored energy sources such as phosphocreatine and glycogen to fuel muscle contractions.

As you continue to perform repeated sprints, your body will become more efficient at clearing lactate, allowing you to perform more sprints before reaching exhaustion.
