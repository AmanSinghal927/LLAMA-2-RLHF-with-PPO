To avoid this, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in each cell of the female body. This means that the same X chromosome is inactive in all of the cells of a female, which is why the correct answer is A.\n\n", "output1": "Because in female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated to avoid a doubling of gene expression. This ensures that the number of X chromosomes is maintained and that the genetic information is not over-expressed.\n\n", "output2": "Because the Y chromosome is not inactivated in the same way as the X chromosome. In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated, but the Y chromosome is not inactivated in male mammals. Therefore, the Y chromosome is not genetically inactive like the X chromosome.\n\n", "output3": "Because X-chromosome inactivation is a process that occurs in female mammals, but not in fruit flies. In fruit flies, the X chromosome is not inactivated, and both X chromosomes are expressed equally in all cells.\n\n"}, {"question": "The pattern of inheritance shown by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is:", "correct_answer": "X-linked recessive.", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)autosomal dominant.", "B)autosomal recessive.", "C)X-linked dominant.", "D)X-linked recessive."], "prompt": "The pattern of inheritance shown by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is:A)autosomal dominant.\nB)autosomal recessive.\nC)X-linked dominant.\nD)X-linked recessive.", "subject_name": "medical_genetics", "output0": "G6PD deficiency is caused by mutations in the G6PD gene, which is located on chromosome 4. The mutations lead to a deficiency in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is important for the breakdown of glucose-6-phosphate. The deficiency can cause a range of symptoms, including anemia, jaundice, and hemolytic crisis.\n\n", "output1": "G6PD deficiency is caused by mutations in the G6PD gene, which is located on chromosome 4. Since the G6PD gene is located on an autosome (chromosome 4), the pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) in order to express the deficiency. If an individual inherits only one mutated copy of the gene, they will not have the deficiency.\n\n", "output2": "G6PD is located on the X chromosome, so the inheritance pattern is X-linked. The deficiency is dominant, meaning that one copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. This means that if a male has one X chromosome with the mutation, he will be affected, while a female carrier will have a 50% chance of passing on the mutation to each of her sons, but only a 25% chance of passing it on to her daughters.\n\n", "output3": "G6PD deficiency is caused by mutations in the G6PD gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Since the X chromosome is inherited in a non-random manner, with males inheriting one X chromosome from their mother and females inheriting one X chromosome from each parent, the risk of G6PD deficiency is higher in males than in females.\n\n"}, {"question": "Homeobox sequences", "correct_answer": "are present in the genome of many animal species", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)are present in the genome of many animal species", "B)are found in prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes", "C)were identified as the integration sites for bacterial viruses", "D)represent integration sites for transposable elements"], "prompt": "Homeobox sequencesA)are present in the genome of many animal species\nB)are found in prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes\nC)were identified as the integration sites for bacterial viruses\nD)represent integration sites for transposable elements", "subject_name": "medical_genetics", "output0": "Homeobox sequences are present in the genomes of many animal species because they are involved in the regulation of gene expression during development.

Instead, they are found in prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea, where they play a role in the regulation of gene expression.\n\n", "output2": "Homeobox sequences are short sequences that are found in the genomes of many animal species. They were first identified as the integration sites for bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria.

They are known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression, but they also have the potential to be involved in the integration of transposable elements.
