If a reflex is present, it could be due to a variety of factors, such as a spinal cord injury or a peripheral nerve injury. But if a reflex is absent, it is more likely to be due to a lesion in the central nervous system, such as a brain or spinal cord injury.\n####user:\n Ah, I see. So it's not the absence of a reflex that indicates a neurological problem, but the absence of a reflex that is a more specific indicator of a neurological problem.\n####assistant:\n Exactly! The absence of a reflex can be a useful diagnostic tool, but it's important to remember that the presence of a reflex does not necessarily rule out a neurological problem.\n\n", "output2": "Because the triceps tendon is located in the antecubital fossa, and tapping it would be the appropriate way to assess the triceps reflex.
