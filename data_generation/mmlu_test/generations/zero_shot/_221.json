What about the consistency of the drainage? Should that be assessed as well?\n####assistant:\n Yes, the consistency of the drainage should also be assessed. It should be noted if the drainage is thin, thick, or has any unusual characteristics.\n####user:\n Got it.

Additionally, cold solutions are more effective at removing bacteria and other debris from the bladder and urethra.\n####user:\n Okay, that makes sense. What is the best way to administer the bladder washout solution?\n####assistant:\n The best way to administer the bladder washout solution is by using a sterile, single-use catheter. The catheter should be inserted into the bladder through the urethra, and the solution should be injected through the catheter. It's important to use aseptic technique to minimize the risk of infection.\n####user:\n Okay, I think I understand. What are some common complications that can occur with bladder washout?\n####assistant:\n Some common complications that can occur with bladder washout include urinary tract infections, bladder perforation, and bleeding.
