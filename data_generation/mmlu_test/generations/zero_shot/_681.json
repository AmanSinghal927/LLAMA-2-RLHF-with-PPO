Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, which can cause these symptoms. The patient's history of irregular menses and acne is also consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), but the patient's age and lack of other symptoms such as infertility and cysts on the ovaries make it less likely. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor and Cushing syndrome are less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as virilization and adrenal mass.\n\n", "output3": "Because the patient's history of irregular menstrual periods, hirsutism, acne, and obesity are all classic symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder that is caused by an imbalance of androgens (male hormones) and estrogens (female hormones) in the body. The androgens cause the symptoms of hirsutism and acne, and the obesity is a common finding in PCOS. The irregular menstrual periods are due to the hormonal imbalance and the enlargement of the ovaries.

The patient's lack of menstruation, normal breast development, and normal appearing external genitalia are consistent with androgen insensitivity. Additionally, the patient's refusal to undergo a pelvic or rectal examination is consistent with the embarrassment and shame that many individuals with androgen insensitivity may feel about their condition.\n\n", "output1": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a condition caused by a defect in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the production of cortisol and aldosterone. This defect leads to the overproduction of androgens, such as testosterone, which can cause virilization and the absence of menstruation. The patient's lack of axillary and pubic hair, as well as her normal breast development, are consistent with CAH. The patient's refusal to undergo a pelvic or rectal examination is also consistent with the condition, as patients with CAH may be embarrassed or ashamed of their physical appearance.\n\n", "output2": "Ectodermal dysplasia is a group of disorders that affect the development of the skin, hair, nails, and teeth. It can cause a range of symptoms, including lack of pubertal development, sparse or absent axillary and pubic hair, and abnormal nail and hair growth. In this case, the patient's lack of pubertal development and normal appearing external genitalia are consistent with ectodermal dysplasia. Androgen insensitivity and congenital adrenal hyperplasia are less likely explanations, as they would be expected to cause more pronounced masculinization of the external genitalia. A psychiatric disorder is not a likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.\n\n", "output3": "The patient's refusal to undergo a pelvic or rectal examination, along with the absence of menstruation and pubertal development, is consistent with a psychiatric disorder rather than a physical condition. It is possible that the patient has a somatoform disorder, which is a type of psychological disorder characterized by physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition. Additionally, the patient's lack of axillary and pubic hair, which are typical signs of puberty, supports the diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.\n\n"}, {"question": "A 68-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a\u00a03-day\u00a0history of worsening fever and headache.

The protein level of 89\u00a0mg/dL in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is significantly elevated, and the presence of pleocytosis suggests an inflammatory response.
