Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T) and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C). This means that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is fixed and does not vary.\n\n", "output3": "The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is always 1:1 because purines and pyrimidines are paired together in a specific manner. Adenine (a purine) always pairs with thymine (a pyrimidine), and guanine (a purine) always pairs with cytosine (a pyrimidine).

This is because the cannula may become blocked or clogged with blood or other debris over time, which can impede the flow of medication or fluids.
