This can lead to an accumulation of the toxin in the body and cause adverse effects.\n\n", "output1": "Pseudocholinesterase deficiency impairs the metabolism of halothane, a potent anesthetic agent, leading to increased sensitivity to its effects.\n\n", "output2": "Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects the breakdown of succinylcholine, a commonly used anesthetic agent. As a result, patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency are more susceptible to the adverse effects of succinylcholine, including increased muscle rigidity and paralysis. Primaquine, a drug used to treat malaria, is also metabolized by the same enzyme, and patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency may experience increased toxicity from primaquine. Therefore, patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency should be closely monitored when receiving succinylcholine or primaquine.\n\n", "output3": "Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase. Individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency have a reduced capacity to hydrolyze succinylcholine, leading to prolonged paralysis and increased risk of respiratory and cardiac complications.\n\n"}, {"question": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:", "correct_answer": "a deletion.", "correct_idx": 0, "options": ["A)a deletion.", "B)a duplication.", "C)a substitution.", "D)an insertion."], "prompt": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:A)a deletion.\nB)a duplication.\nC)a substitution.\nD)an insertion.", "subject_name": "medical_genetics", "output0": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides (\u0394F508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.\n\n", "output1": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation is a duplication of the CTFR gene, which codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein.

This is particularly important for gene therapy, where the goal is to provide a long-term correction of the disease.\n\n", "output1": "Adenoviruses have a relatively low risk of insertional mutagenesis because they do not integrate into the host genome. Instead, they remain as an episomal plasmid, which can be easily removed from the cell. This makes them a safer choice for gene therapy compared to other viral vectors like retroviruses, which can integrate into the host genome and potentially cause harm.\n\n", "output2": "Adenoviruses are not as immunogenic as retroviruses, meaning they are less likely to trigger an immune response against the vector. This is because adenoviruses are non-enveloped viruses that are not as easily recognized by the immune system. Additionally, the viral capsid of adenoviruses is highly variable, which makes it more difficult for the immune system to recognize and mount an effective response against the vector.\n\n", "output3": "Adenoviruses are well suited for gene therapy because they are easy to manipulate and can be assembled with a variety of vectors.\n\n"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements about Hirschsprung disease is incorrect?", "correct_answer": "It is more common in girls than in boys.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)It shows an association with Down syndrome.", "B)It is more common in girls than in boys.", "C)RET is a major susceptibility gene.", "D)Recurrence risks are greater for long segment disease than for short segment disease."], "prompt": "Which of the following statements about Hirschsprung disease is incorrect?A)It shows an association with Down syndrome.\nB)It is more common in girls than in boys.\nC)RET is a major susceptibility gene.\nD)Recurrence risks are greater for long segment disease than for short segment disease.", "subject_name": "medical_genetics", "output0": "Hirschsprung disease is not associated with Down syndrome.
