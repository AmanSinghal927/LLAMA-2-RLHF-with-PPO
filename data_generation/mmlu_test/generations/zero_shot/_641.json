Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?", "correct_answer": "Normal development", "correct_idx": 3, "options": ["A)Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor", "B)Peutz-Jeghers syndrome", "C)Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome)", "D)Normal development"], "prompt": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a physical examination prior to participating in sports. He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?A)Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor\nB)Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\nC)Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome)\nD)Normal development", "subject_name": "professional_medicine", "output0": "The patient's symptoms of breast enlargement and normal testes and penis are consistent with estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor, which is a rare condition. The patient's pubic hair development is also consistent with this diagnosis. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by pigmented macules on the skin, but it is not associated with breast enlargement. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by hypogonadism and abnormalities of the testes, but it is not associated with breast enlargement. Normal development is not a likely cause of breast enlargement in a 14-year-old boy.\n\n", "output1": "The patient has a family history of breast cancer, and the presence of bilateral breast masses is consistent with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, including the breasts. The patient's breast enlargement is likely due to the presence of these hamartomatous polyps.\n\n", "output2": "Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the testes and is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome. This results in a higher level of estrogen production and breast enlargement. The patient's symptoms of breast enlargement, normal penis and testes, and Tanner stage 3 pubic hair development are consistent with Klinefelter syndrome. The serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone being within the reference ranges also supports the diagnosis.\n\n", "output3": "Because breast development is a normal part of male puberty, and the patient's age and height/weight ratio are within the normal range. The presence of bilateral fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex is consistent with the normal development of breast tissue in boys. The patient's serum hormone concentrations are also within the reference range, further supporting the diagnosis of normal development.\n\n"}]
