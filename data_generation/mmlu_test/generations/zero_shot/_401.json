The gene encodes a protein called the ryanodine receptor, which is involved in the regulation of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle fibers. When the gene is mutated, the protein is not functioning properly, leading to an increase in calcium release and a decrease in the ability of the muscle to relax. This can cause a hypermetabolic state, leading to hyperthermia.\n\n", "output3": "Malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is caused by mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Because the X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes, and because the ryanodine receptor gene is located on the X chromosome, the pattern of inheritance is X-linked recessive.
