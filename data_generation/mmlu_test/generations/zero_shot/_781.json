This process is essential for the virus to multiply and spread. The viral DNA is incorporated into the host cell's chromosome, which allows the virus to use the host cell's machinery to replicate and produce new viral particles.\n\n", "output1": "When an influenza virus infects a cell, it immediately starts to replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins. However, the host cell\u2019s transcriptional machinery is a threat to the virus, as it could be used to produce proteins that could inhibit or destroy the virus. Therefore, the virus destroys the host cell\u2019s transcriptional machinery to prevent this from happening.\n\n", "output2": "The influenza virus uses the cell's own machinery to replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins. This process is called lytic replication. Once the new viral particles are assembled, the cell is destroyed, releasing the viruses into the surrounding environment.\n\n", "output3": "Because the influenza virus is a retrovirus, which means it has a reverse transcriptase enzyme that it uses to convert its RNA genome into DNA.

This type of cleavage is seen in organisms that undergo external fertilization, such as the sea urchin. In contrast, meroblastic cleavage occurs in organisms that undergo internal fertilization, and results in an asymmetrical distribution of cells.

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and only allows certain molecules to pass through. In order to target a protein to the plasma membrane, it needs to have a signal peptide that directs it to the secretory pathway. The signal peptide is a short sequence of amino acids at the beginning of the protein that tells the cell where to target the protein. In this case, the protein needs two signal peptides, one for each destination, in order to be targeted to the plasma membrane and the lysosome.\n\n", "output1": "The protein you are referring to is a secretory protein. Secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are targeted for secretion outside of the cell. In order to reach their destination, secretory proteins must be transported across the ER membrane and then released from the cell. The signal peptide is responsible for targeting the protein to the ER membrane, and a second signal peptide is required for targeting the protein to the lysosome for degradation.\n\n", "output2": "The newly synthesized protein is most likely to be targeted to the cytosol because it lacks a signal peptide, which is necessary for targeting to the plasma membrane or other organelles. The cytosol is the most common compartment in the cell where proteins without a signal peptide are found.\n\n", "output3": "The targeting of a newly synthesized protein to the chloroplast requires a signal peptide that is different from the signal peptide required for targeting to the plasma membrane or other organelles.
