In hot, dry environments, plants have evolved to have more stomata to minimize water loss through transpiration. This allows the plant to conserve water and survive in environments with high temperatures.\n\n", "output1": "The cuticle is a waxy layer that covers the leaves of plants and helps to prevent water loss through transpiration. In hot and dry environments, the cuticle becomes thicker and more water-repellent to minimize water loss. This adaptation is especially important for plants that live in deserts and other arid environments.\n\n", "output2": "Plants in hot, dry environments often have spines instead of leaves to minimize water loss through transpiration. Spines are a modified form of leaves that have a lower surface area and therefore lose less water through transpiration. Additionally, spines can help to protect the plant from herbivores and other environmental stresses.\n\n", "output3": "Because plants in hot environments need to maximize their surface area to release heat and minimize water loss.
