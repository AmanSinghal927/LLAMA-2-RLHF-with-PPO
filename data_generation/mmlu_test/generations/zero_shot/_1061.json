Urea is then excreted in the urine. This process is important for maintaining blood glucose levels and preventing a buildup of lactate in the circulation.\n\n", "output1": "The heart is a highly active tissue, and its high energy demands are met in part by the oxidation of lactate. The lactate is taken up by the heart via a specific transport system, and is then converted to glucose through the action of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This process is known as the Cori cycle.\n\n", "output2": "Because lactate is not metabolized by the liver, but rather excreted in the urine. The kidneys are responsible for filtering out lactate from the blood and excreting it in the urine.\n\n", "output3": "Because lactate is a source of energy for other tissues, such as the heart, brain, and other muscles. It is transported in the blood to these tissues, where it is oxidized to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell. This process is known as the Cori cycle, named after the scientist who discovered it, Hans A. Cori.\n\n"}, {"question": "The ATP store in muscle can only supply energy in high intensity exercise for about:", "correct_answer": "2 seconds.", "correct_idx": 1, "options": ["A)2 milliseconds.", "B)2 seconds.", "C)10 seconds.", "D)20 seconds."], "prompt": "The ATP store in muscle can only supply energy in high intensity exercise for about:A)2 milliseconds.\nB)2 seconds.\nC)10 seconds.\nD)20 seconds.", "subject_name": "college_medicine", "output0": "Because the ATP store in muscle is limited and can only supply energy for short bursts of high-intensity exercise before it runs out.

When you exercise, your body releases insulin to help your muscles use glucose for energy. As a result, the glycogen stored in your muscles is broken down and converted into glucose, which is then used to fuel your muscles during exercise.\n\n", "output1": "Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress, which can include exercise. It helps to break down glycogen in muscle tissue, which can provide energy for exercise.\n\n", "output2": "When muscles contract, they produce lactic acid as a byproduct.

This mechanism is a negative feedback loop, which helps to regulate the stress response and prevent overproduction of cortisol.\n\n", "output1": "When the body is exposed to stress, the hypothalamus releases CRF, which stimulates the release of cortisol from the adrenal gland. This triggers a cascade of physiological responses that help the body cope with the stress. However, this response is not sustainable in the long term, and the body has mechanisms to shut off the stress response once the stress has passed. One of these mechanisms is the exhaustion of the body\u2019s store of CRF. When the store of CRF is depleted, the hypothalamus is unable to release more CRF, and the stress response is eventually shut off.\n\n", "output2": "When cortisol levels become too high, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland receive negative feedback signals to reduce the release of CRF and ACTH.
