The H+ ions move down their concentration gradient, driven by the electrical potential difference between the inside and outside of the mitochondria.

This is known as passive diffusion.\n\n", "output2": "The mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is active transport, because it requires energy to move the H+ ions against their concentration gradient.

If the proteins are not treated with a detergent like SDS, they may denature, or lose their native structure, during the electrophoresis process.
